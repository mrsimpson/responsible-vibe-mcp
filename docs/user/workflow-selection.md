# Automatic Workflow Selection

Your AI agent automatically picks the right development methodology based on what you're trying to do. No configuration needed – it just works.

## How It Works

When you ask your AI to help with development, it analyzes your request and selects the appropriate workflow:

**"Build a todo app"** → **Greenfield workflow**  
_Full planning cycle for new projects_

**"Add user authentication"** → **EPCC workflow**  
_Iterative approach for feature additions_

**"The login is broken"** → **Bugfix workflow**  
_Systematic debugging process_

**"I want to use TDD"** → **TDD workflow**  
_Test-driven development cycle_

## The Selection Logic

Your AI reads the MCP tool descriptions and learns the patterns:

```json
{
  "name": "start_development",
  "description": "Choose from different development approaches (waterfall, bugfix, epcc) or use a custom workflow",
  "parameters": {
    "workflow": "waterfall, epcc, tdd, bugfix, greenfield, minor, or custom workflow name"
  }
}
```

Based on context clues in your request, it picks the most appropriate methodology.

## Manual Override

Want to use a specific workflow? Just ask:

**"Build a todo app using TDD"** → TDD workflow  
**"Add authentication with the waterfall approach"** → Waterfall workflow  
**"Use EPCC to implement search"** → EPCC workflow

## Explore All Workflows

Want to see what's available? Check out the **[Interactive Workflow Visualizer](../workflows)** – it shows all methodologies with their phases, transitions, and use cases.

You can explore:

- **Waterfall**: Classical V-model for large, design-heavy projects
- **EPCC**: Anthropic's approach for iterative development
- **TDD**: Test-driven development with red-green-refactor
- **Bugfix**: Systematic reproduce-analyze-fix-verify cycle
- **Greenfield**: Comprehensive planning for new projects
- **Minor**: Streamlined approach for small changes

## Why This Matters

Most development tools force you into one approach. Responsible Vibe recognizes that **different problems need different methodologies**.

Building something from scratch? You need comprehensive planning.  
Adding a feature? Iterative development works better.  
Fixing a bug? Systematic debugging is key.

Your AI knows the difference and adapts accordingly.
