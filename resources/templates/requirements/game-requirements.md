## 🎯 Core Game Principle

<!-- LLM INSTRUCTION:
This section captures the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM game - the simplest possible version that's still fun.
Think: "What's the ONE thing that makes this game special?"
Example: For a space shooter: "Player shoots enemies that move toward them"
Example: For a platformer: "Player jumps over gaps to reach the end"
Keep it to ONE sentence that describes the core gameplay loop.
-->

**The Main Idea** (in one sentence):

[CORE_GAME_MECHANIC] - e.g., "A player dodges falling objects and collects coins"

**What Makes It Fun**:

[WHY_IS_THIS_FUN] - e.g., "It's exciting to see how long you can survive!"

**Game Type**: [e.g., Arcade, Platformer, Puzzle, Space Shooter]

## 🚀 Version 1: Let's Build This First!

<!-- LLM INSTRUCTION:
These are the MINIMUM features needed to make the core game principle playable.
Aim for 3-5 SIMPLE features. Child should be able to build this in 1-2 sessions.
Each feature should be testable and celebratable when complete.
Use simple, action-oriented language kids understand.
-->

**Goal**: Make a playable game with just the basics!

### Must-Have Features:

**1. [FEATURE_1]** 🎮

- Example: "Player can move left and right"
- Why we need it: So you can control your character!

**2. [FEATURE_2]** 🎯

- Example: "Enemies appear at the top and move down"
- Why we need it: Something to dodge or shoot!

**3. [FEATURE_3]** ⭐

- Example: "Score goes up when you collect coins"
- Why we need it: To know how well you're doing!

**4. [FEATURE_4]** 💥

- Example: "Game over when player hits enemy"
- Why we need it: Games need a win/lose condition!

**5. [FEATURE_5]** 🔄

- Example: "Restart button to play again"
- Why we need it: So you can try to beat your score!

### ✅ How We Know Version 1 is Done:

- [ ] I can start the game and see my character
- [ ] I can control my character with the keyboard
- [ ] [MAIN_THING] works (e.g., "Enemies appear and move")
- [ ] I can win OR lose the game
- [ ] I can play again after game over

**When Version 1 is done**: We have a REAL GAME! 🎉

**New features can be added incrementally – just start a new conversation and explain them**

## 🚧 Not Building This now (And That's OK!)

<!-- LLM INSTRUCTION:
Be explicit about what's out of scope to manage expectations.
Help child understand why some things are too complex for now.
Always end on a positive note about what they ARE building.
-->

**Things We're NOT Building** (maybe later!):

- ❌ [OUT_OF_SCOPE_1] - e.g., "Multiplayer" → Too complex! Let's master single-player first
- ❌ [OUT_OF_SCOPE_2] - e.g., "3D graphics" → 2D is perfect for learning!
- ❌ [OUT_OF_SCOPE_3] - e.g., "Mobile app" → Browser version is easier to share!

**Why not?** These would take a LONG time and lots of advanced skills. What we're building is already AWESOME! 🌟
