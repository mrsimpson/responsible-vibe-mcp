<!--
DESIGN DOCUMENT TEMPLATE - FREESTYLE APPROACH

PURPOSE: Document design principles and standards in your preferred format.
NOTE: Technology stack decisions belong in the Architecture Document, not here.

DESIGN FOCUS AREAS:
✅ Design principles and patterns that guide implementation
✅ Naming conventions and coding standards
✅ Component design approaches and boundaries
✅ Data modeling and design principles
✅ Quality attribute design strategies (performance, security, etc.)
❌ NO Technology stack choices (goes in Architecture doc)
❌ NO Concrete class names or implementations
❌ NO Code snippets or method signatures

TIERED APPROACH SUGGESTION:
Start with core design principles, add complexity as project grows.
Consider organizing by: Essential → Core → Advanced → Specialized sections.

EXAMPLES:
✅ GOOD: "Repository pattern abstracts data access with clean interfaces"
✅ GOOD: "Components follow single responsibility principle with clear boundaries"
✅ GOOD: "Error handling uses custom exception hierarchy for different failure types"
❌ BAD: "PaymentController.processPayment() validates and processes transactions"
❌ BAD: "UserService extends BaseService and implements AuthService interface"
