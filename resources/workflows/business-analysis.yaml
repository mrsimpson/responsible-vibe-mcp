    default_instructions: >
      You are in the document discovery phase. Gather documents and create standardized Business Capability Modeling structure.

      **Step 1: Interactive Document Gathering**
      Ask user to identify and provide available documents:
      - Business process documentation
      - Organizational charts
      - System documentation
      - Existing c4-analysis results
      - Business requirements documents

      IMPORTANT: In this phase, do not read the documents yet!

      **Step 2: Create Document Processing Tasks**
      For each gathered document, add task to plan file:
      "- [ ] Summarize [document-name] using structured chapter-by-chapter approach"

      Update plan file with discovery progress and processing tasks.
    transitions:

        transition_reason: 'Documents gathered and Business Capability Modeling structure created, ready for consolidation'

  documents_consolidation:
    description: 'Process and consolidate gathered documents using structured summarization'
    default_instructions: >
      You are in the documents consolidation phase. Process each document systematically using basic structured summarization.

      **Step 1: Apply Structured Summarization Technique**
      For each document, use this approach:

      1. Read document chapter by chapter
      2. Maintain original hierarchical structure
      3. Condense content while preserving key information
      4. Create [document-name]-processed.md file
      5. Mark task complete in plan file

      **Summarization Guidelines:**
      - Create structured summary based exclusively on source document information
      - Identify chapters and hierarchy levels systematically
      - Summarize level-by-level into [document-name]-processed.md
      - Write chapter summaries in natural language (no bullet points)
      - Include information about potential capabilities, services, processes, or actors
      - Maintain folder structure if documents have associated folders

      **Step 2: Create Bibliography**
      Create BIBLIOGRAPHY.md with:
      - "sources" section listing all processed documents
      - "terms" section with important business terms and their source references

      IMPORTANT: This phase focuses only on basic document processing. Business analysis happens in the next phase.

    default_instructions: >
      You are in the business content analysis phase. Focus on identifying and analyzing business-relevant content.

      **Step 1: Review Processed Documents**
      Review all [document-name]-processed.md files from consolidation phase.
      Identify chapters that contain business-relevant content:
      - Business processes and workflows
      - Organizational roles and responsibilities
      - Business capabilities and functions
      - Services and customer interactions
      - Business rules and policies

      **Step 2: Create Business Analysis Tasks**
      For each business-relevant chapter identified, add a task to the plan file:
      "- [ ] Create detailed business analysis of [document-name] Chapter [X]: [chapter-title]"

      IMPORTANT: You MUST add these tasks to the plan file before proceeding.

      **Step 3: Execute Business Analysis Tasks**
      For each business analysis task:
      1. Read the specific chapter in detail
      2. Extract business information focusing on:
         - What business capabilities are mentioned
         - What services or processes are described
         - Who (roles/actors) performs the work
         - Why (business value/purpose) it exists
      3. Create detailed business summary emphasizing WHAT, WHY, WHO (not HOW)
      4. Mark task complete in plan file

      **Step 4: Update Bibliography**
      Update BIBLIOGRAPHY.md with business terms found during detailed analysis:
      - check whether the "sources" section already contains an entry it. If not: create one (max 5 letters in brackets).
      - In the "terms" section, check whether there is an entry for it - If not, create an entry for It
      - add a reference to the source + chapter

      --- sample 1 ---
