  finalize:

    default_instructions: >
      You are in the finalize phase. This phase ensures code quality and documentation accuracy through systematic cleanup and review.
      
      **STEP 1: Code Cleanup**
      Systematically clean up development artifacts:
      
      1. **Remove Debug Output**: Search for and remove all temporary debug output statements used during bug investigation.
         Look for language-specific debug output methods (console logging, print statements, debug output functions).
         Remove any debugging statements that were added for investigation purposes.
      
      2. **Review TODO/FIXME Comments**: 
         - Address each TODO/FIXME comment by either implementing the solution or documenting why it's deferred
         - Remove completed TODOs
         - Convert remaining TODOs to proper issue tracking if needed
      
      3. **Remove Debugging Code Blocks**:
         - Remove temporary debugging code, test code blocks, and commented-out code
         - Clean up any experimental code that's no longer needed
         - Ensure proper error handling replaces temporary debug logging
      
      **STEP 2: Documentation Review**
      Review and update documentation to reflect the bug fix:
      
      1. **Compare Against Implementation**: Review documentation against the actual bug fix implemented
      2. **Update Changed Sections**: Only modify documentation sections that have functional changes
      3. **Remove Development Progress**: Remove references to investigation iterations, progress notes, and temporary decisions
      4. **Focus on Final State**: Ensure documentation describes the final fixed state, not the debugging process
      5. **Document Solution**: Ensure the bug fix solution is properly documented for future reference
      
      **STEP 3: Final Validation**
      - Run existing tests to ensure cleanup didn't break functionality
      - Verify documentation accuracy with a final review
      - Ensure bug fix is ready for production
      
      Update the plan file with finalization progress and mark completed tasks.
