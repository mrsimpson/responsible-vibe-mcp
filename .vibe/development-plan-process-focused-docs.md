## Key Decisions
- **Current State Analysis**: Documentation is spread across README.md (project root), docs/ folder with VitePress, and various scattered files
- **Main Pain Points Identified**: 
  - Complex setup process requiring system prompt configuration
  - Multiple entry points (README vs docs site) creating confusion
  - Technical implementation details mixed with user guidance
  - No clear progressive disclosure for different user types (beginners vs advanced)
- **CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: Missing advanced engineering practices documentation is a major gap
- **USER FEEDBACK INTEGRATION**: 
  - âœ… Universal MCP agent support (not just preconfigured ones)
  - âœ… Multiple battle-tested workflows (not single linear process)
  - âœ… Detailed "How it works" + differentiation from other tools
  - âœ… Simplified structure (removed unclear Reference/Examples sections)
- **REVISED INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE**:
  ```
  README.md (Project Root) - 30-second value prop + instant setup
  â”œâ”€â”€ Quick Start (2 minutes to first success)
  â””â”€â”€ Link to full documentation site
  
  Documentation Site (docs/)
  â”œâ”€â”€ Getting Started
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ What is Responsible Vibe? (value proposition + differentiation)
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ How It Works (detailed mechanics + vs other tools)
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Quick Setup (universal MCP + preconfigured agents)
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ First Feature (guided tutorial)
  â”œâ”€â”€ User Guides
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Automatic Workflow Selection (AI picks based on context + manual override)
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Hands-On Tutorial (greenfield â†’ enhancement â†’ bugfix)
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Advanced Engineering (setup_project_docs, variables, branches, rules)
  â””â”€â”€ Interactive Workflows (/workflows route - existing workflow-visualizer)
  ```
- **CONTENT STRATEGY BY PERSONA**:
  - **Beginner (First-time users)**: Value prop â†’ Universal MCP setup â†’ Hands-on tutorial (3 workflows)
  - **Intermediate (Regular users)**: Automatic workflow selection, manual override options
  - **Advanced (Power users)**: Engineering practices, custom workflows, rule files integration, trunk-based development
- **REVISED README.md STRUCTURE** (Max 2KB, focused on quick wins):
  ```
  # Responsible Vibe MCP
  [badges]
  
  Transform any AI coding agent into a structured development partner with battle-tested engineering workflows.
  
  ## âš¡ Quick Start
  # Works with ANY MCP-compatible agent
  npx responsible-vibe-mcp --generate-config amazonq-cli  # or claude, gemini, opencode
  # OR manually configure any MCP agent with our system prompt
  
  Ask your AI: "Help me implement a new feature"
  â†’ Your agent now follows proven development methodologies
  
  ## What You Get
  âœ… Multiple battle-tested workflows (waterfall, EPCC, TDD, bugfix, greenfield)
  âœ… Context-aware process guidance (different practices for different scenarios)
  âœ… Project memory across conversations and branches
  âœ… Automatic documentation and decision tracking
  
  ## Universal MCP Support
  Any MCP-compatible agent | Preconfigured: Amazon Q CLI, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode CLI
  
  ðŸ“– **[Complete Documentation â†’](https://mrsimpson.github.io/responsible-vibe-mcp/)**
  ```
- **REVISED VITEPRESS SITE RESTRUCTURE**:
  - **New Sidebar**: Getting Started (4 items) â†’ User Guides (3 items) â†’ Interactive Workflows (link to /workflows)
  - **Landing Page**: Value prop + differentiation + visual demo + universal MCP setup
  - **"How It Works" Section**: Detailed mechanics + what makes it different from other agentic tools
  - **Leverage Existing**: Use workflow-visualizer at /workflows route instead of duplicating content
- **"HOW IT WORKS" CONTENT STRATEGY**:
  ```
  ## How Responsible Vibe Works
  
  ### The Problem with Other Agentic Tools
  - Most AI coding tools are reactive (respond to requests)
  - No structured development methodology
  - No project memory or context persistence
  - One-size-fits-all approach
  
  ### Responsible Vibe's Approach
  - Proactive process guidance (tells AI what to do next)
  - Battle-tested engineering workflows for different scenarios
  - Persistent project memory across conversations and branches
  - Context-aware methodology selection
  
  ### Technical Architecture
  [MCP Server] â†” [AI Agent] â†” [You]
  - MCP server maintains state and provides phase-specific instructions
  - AI agent follows structured workflows instead of ad-hoc responses
  - You get consistent, methodical development process
  
  ### What Makes It Different
  1. Process-focused (not just tool-focused)
  2. Multiple proven methodologies (not single workflow)
  3. Long-term project memory (not conversation-limited)
  4. Universal MCP compatibility (not agent-specific)
  ```
- **ADVANCED ENGINEERING PRACTICES SECTION**:
  ```
  /guides/advanced-engineering/
  â”œâ”€â”€ project-documentation.md (setup_project_docs, templates, linking)
  â”œâ”€â”€ workflow-variables.md ($ARCHITECTURE_DOC, $REQUIREMENTS_DOC, etc.)
  â”œâ”€â”€ trunk-based-development.md (branch-specific plans, conversation isolation)
  â”œâ”€â”€ rule-files-integration.md (process vs deliverable guidance)
  â””â”€â”€ long-term-memory.md (.vibe/docs structure, persistence)
  ```
- **CONTENT MIGRATION STRATEGY**:
  - **Phase 1**: New README.md (replace current 7.3KB with 2KB focused version)
  - **Phase 2**: Create new landing page and getting started section
  - **Phase 3**: Migrate existing content to new structure (user guides, reference)
  - **Phase 4**: Create advanced engineering practices section (net new content)
  - **Phase 5**: Add examples and integration patterns
- **VALIDATION APPROACH**:
  - **Success Metrics**: Time to first success <2 minutes, setup completion rate >90%
  - **User Scenarios**: New user setup, existing user finding advanced features, troubleshooting
  - **Testing Method**: Documentation walkthrough with different personas
**Current Documentation Structure:**
- **README.md**: 7.3KB, comprehensive but overwhelming for new users
- **docs/**: VitePress site with user guide, workflows, and dev docs
- **Sidebar Structure**: User Guide (5 items) + Development (4 items)
- **Key User Journey**: Get system prompt â†’ Configure agent â†’ Start using

**Identified Issues:**
1. **Cognitive Overload**: README tries to cover everything at once
2. **Setup Friction**: Multiple manual steps required even with "quick start"
3. **Mixed Audiences**: Beginners and advanced users see same content
4. **Scattered Information**: Setup info in multiple places
5. **No Progressive Onboarding**: All-or-nothing approach

**Best Practices Research:**
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with value prop, then simple setup, then advanced features
- **Success-First Approach**: Get users to success quickly, explain complexity later
- **Audience Segmentation**: Clear paths for different user types (new vs experienced)
- **Minimal Viable Setup**: Reduce friction to absolute minimum for first experience
- **Just-in-Time Information**: Provide details when users need them, not upfront

**Recommended New Structure:**
1. **Landing Page**: Clear value prop + 30-second setup
2. **Quick Start**: Minimal path to first success
3. **Guides**: Step-by-step tutorials for common scenarios
4. **Reference**: Complete documentation for advanced users
5. **Examples**: Real-world use cases and patterns

**CRITICAL MISSING: Advanced Engineering Practices**
- **setup_project_docs Tool**: Creates/links architecture.md, requirements.md, design.md with templates or symlinks
- **Workflow Variables**: $ARCHITECTURE_DOC, $REQUIREMENTS_DOC, $DESIGN_DOC for dynamic path resolution
- **Trunk-Based Development**: Automatic plan file naming per branch (development-plan-{branch}.md)
- **Rule Files Integration**: .amazonq/rules/ provides HOW of deliverables, responsible-vibe provides HOW of process
- **Long-Term Memory**: Persistent project context across conversations via .vibe/docs/ structure

**Advanced Features Discovered:**
- **Branch-Aware Conversations**: Each git branch gets its own conversation ID and plan file
- **Template System**: Multiple templates (arc42, comprehensive, freestyle, none) for project docs
- **File Linking**: Can symlink existing docs instead of creating new ones
- **Variable Substitution**: Runtime path resolution in workflow instructions
