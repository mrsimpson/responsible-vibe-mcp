# Development Plan: responsible-vibe (fix-mcp-inspector branch)

*Generated on 2025-09-04 by Vibe Feature MCP*
*Workflow: [bugfix](https://mrsimpson.github.io/responsible-vibe-mcp/workflows/bugfix)*

## Goal
Fix MCP inspector UI loading issue where server declares logging capability but doesn't implement the logging/setLevel method, causing connection failures.

## Reproduce
### Tasks
- [x] Examine error messages from MCP inspector
- [x] Identify server declares logging capability but doesn't implement logging/setLevel
- [x] Found server initialization with logging capabilities in server-config.ts
- [x] Successfully reproduced the issue with MCP inspector
- [x] Confirmed error toast: "Server declares logging capability but doesn't implement method: 'logging/setLevel'"
- [x] Confirmed server logs: "[MCP-LOG-ERROR] Failed to send log notification: Error: Not connected"

### Completed
- [x] Created development plan file

## Analyze

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] Bug has been successfully reproduced
- [x] Error conditions and symptoms are documented
- [x] Environment and steps to reproduce are clear

### Tasks
- [x] Examine MCP SDK types to understand logging requirements
- [x] Identify that `logging/setLevel` method must be implemented when declaring logging capabilities
- [x] Understand that MCP protocol requires `setRequestHandler` for `logging/setLevel` method
- [x] Confirm root cause: Server declares logging capability but doesn't register the required request handler

### Completed
- [x] Root cause analysis complete

## Fix

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] Root cause has been identified
- [x] Fix approach has been determined
- [x] Impact assessment is complete

### Tasks
- [x] Reconsider approach: implement logging/setLevel handler (simpler than initially thought)
- [x] Add setRequestHandler for logging/setLevel in server-config.ts
- [x] Test fix with MCP inspector - CONFIRMED WORKING
- [x] User requested proper logging level propagation to our logging system
- [x] Unified logging levels - removed dual-level confusion
- [x] MCP logging level now controls both stderr output AND MCP notifications
- [x] Updated logging/setLevel handler to actually set the unified level
- [x] Test logging level changes in MCP inspector - CONFIRMED WORKING

### Completed
- [x] Fix implemented and tested successfully

## Verify

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [ ] Fix has been implemented
- [ ] Code changes are complete
- [ ] Fix addresses the root cause

### Tasks
- [ ] *To be added when this phase becomes active*

### Completed
*None yet*

## Finalize

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [ ] Fix has been verified to work
- [ ] No regressions have been introduced
- [ ] Testing is complete
### Tasks
- [ ] *To be added when this phase becomes active*

### Completed
*None yet*

## Key Decisions
- **Root Cause Identified**: Server declares `logging: {}` capability in server-config.ts but doesn't implement the required `logging/setLevel` method
- **Error Location**: `/src/server/server-config.ts` line ~60 where McpServer is initialized with logging capabilities
- **Impact**: MCP inspector cannot connect to server due to missing logging method implementation
- **Technical Analysis**: MCP protocol requires `setRequestHandler` for `logging/setLevel` method when logging capability is declared
- **Fix Strategy**: Implement the `logging/setLevel` handler with proper level propagation
- **Unified Logging**: Simplified from dual logging levels to single unified level that controls both stderr and MCP notifications
- **Priority Order**: MCP client level > environment variable > explicit level > default (INFO)
