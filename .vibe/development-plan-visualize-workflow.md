## Plan

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] The problem space has been thoroughly explored and understood
- [x] Existing codebase patterns and architecture have been analyzed
- [x] Requirements and scope are clearly defined
- [x] Alternative approaches have been considered and documented

### Technical Architecture
**Frontend Stack:**
- **TypeScript** - Full type safety using existing project types
- **Vite Dev Server** - Run TypeScript directly without compilation
- **D3.js** - For state machine visualization and graph layout
- **js-yaml** - For parsing YAML workflow files
- **Modern CSS** - Grid/Flexbox for layout, CSS custom properties for theming

**Type Safety Strategy:**
- Import existing `YamlStateMachine`, `YamlState`, `YamlTransition` from `../src/state-machine-types.ts`
- Create additional types for UI state and visualization data
- Strict TypeScript configuration for better error catching
- Type-safe D3.js usage with proper generic types

**Application Structure (Single Responsibility Principle):**

    └── components.css           # UI component styles
```

**Resource Access Strategy:**
- **Direct fetch**: Use `fetch('../resources/workflows/workflow-name.yaml')` from the web app
- **Vite static serving**: Configure Vite to serve the resources folder
- **No file copying or symlinking needed**
- **Dynamic loading**: Load workflows on demand

**Verbose Code Philosophy:**
- Clear, descriptive function and variable names
- Explicit type annotations even when TypeScript can infer
- Separate functions for each distinct operation
- Detailed comments explaining business logic
- Prefer multiple simple functions over complex one-liners
- Explicit error handling rather than implicit assumptions

### Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: Project Setup & Type Safety**
- Set up Vite configuration for TypeScript development
- Create proper directory structure following SRP
- Import existing type definitions from main project
- Set up symlink to existing `/resources/workflows/` folder
- Configure TypeScript with strict settings

**Phase 2: Core Services (Data Layer)**
- Implement WorkflowLoader service (load from resources + upload)
- Create YamlParser service with proper validation
- Build FileUploadHandler with error handling
- Add comprehensive type definitions for UI state

**Phase 3: Visualization Engine (Rendering Layer)**
- Implement DiagramRenderer with D3.js setup
- Create LayoutEngine for automatic state positioning
- Build StateRenderer for individual state nodes
- Implement TransitionRenderer for arrows and labels

**Phase 4: UI Controllers (Interaction Layer)**
- Create SidePanelController for content display
- Implement InteractionHandler for click/hover events
- Build HighlightManager for path highlighting
- Add WorkflowSelector for workflow switching

**Phase 5: Integration & Polish**
- Connect all services and controllers
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Implement responsive design
- Add loading states and user feedback

### Edge Cases & Challenges

**YAML Processing:**
- Invalid YAML syntax in uploaded files
- Missing required fields (name, states, transitions)
- Circular references in state transitions
- Very large workflows (performance considerations)

**Visualization Challenges:**
- Multiple transitions between same states (need curved arrows)
- Self-referencing transitions (loops back to same state)
- Very long state names or transition labels
- Workflows with many states (layout complexity)

**UI/UX Considerations:**
- Mobile/tablet responsiveness with side panel
- Very long instruction text in side panel
- Loading states for file processing
- Graceful degradation for older browsers

**Performance Considerations:**
- Large YAML files (>1MB)
- Complex workflows with many states/transitions
- Smooth animations without blocking UI
- Memory management for multiple loaded workflows

## Key Decisions
- **Target Audience**: Workflow authors (developers creating/editing YAML workflows)
- **Approach**: Simple web app for visualization, not integrated into MCP server
- **Layout Strategy**: Side panel for detailed text with path highlighting in diagram
- **Workflow Loading**: Load from existing `/resources/workflows/` + file upload capability
- **Visual Style**: Formal state machine (circles/arrows) but modern (colors, fonts, spacing)
- **Interactivity**: Basic interaction (click states/transitions to see details)
- **Technology Stack**: TypeScript + Vite dev server + D3.js + existing type definitions
- **Architecture**: Single Responsibility Principle with verbose, clear code
- **Type Safety**: Reuse existing YamlStateMachine interfaces from src/state-machine-types.ts
- **Development**: Vite dev server for TypeScript without compilation step

## Notes
## Notes
## Notes
**YAML Content Analysis:**
- **Instructions**: Multi-line text blocks (50-200+ words each)
- **Descriptions**: Short to medium (10-50 words)
- **Transition reasons**: Short explanatory text (5-15 words)
- **Structure**: 4-6 states per workflow, 2-5 transitions per state
- **Text formatting**: Uses YAML block scalars (>) for long instructions

**UI/UX Requirements:**
- **Layout**: Split view - diagram on left, details panel on right
- **Highlighting**: Selected state/transition highlighted in diagram
- **Path visualization**: Show transition path when clicked
- **Modern styling**: Clean typography, good spacing, modern color palette
- **Responsive**: Should work on different screen sizes

**Technical Requirements:**
- **YAML parsing**: Browser-based YAML parser (js-yaml)
- **Graph visualization**: D3.js or similar for state machine rendering
- **File handling**: Upload capability + pre-loaded workflows
- **State management**: Track selected elements and highlighting
- **Layout algorithm**: Automatic positioning of states with good spacing

**Workflow Integration:**
- **Built-in workflows**: Load from `/resources/workflows/` (5 existing)
- **Upload support**: Allow users to upload custom YAML files
- **Validation**: Basic YAML structure validation
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of malformed workflows
