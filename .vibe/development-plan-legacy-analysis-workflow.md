## Key Decisions
- **Scope**: Repository-based systems (any technology that fits in a repo)
- **Progressive Goals**: 
  1. Help developers understand the system
  2. Enable coherent enhancements via responsible-vibe-mcp
  3. Provide basis for end-to-end API testing
  4. Enable system renewal/modernization
- **Documentation Strategy**: Discover existing docs and enhance/link them, or create new C4-based architecture and comprehensive design docs
- **Template Strategy**: Create new C4-based architecture template (not Arc42 modification) + reuse comprehensive design template
- **Technology Examples**: Focus on Java (Maven/Gradle) and Node.js in workflow instructions
- **C4 Methodology**: Align phases with C4 levels (Context, Container, Component - excluding Code level)
- **Scope Limiting**: Each phase must have strict scope limits to avoid context overflow in large codebases
- **Discovery Notes Structure**: 
  - Free-form notes in .vibe/docs/DISCOVERY.md
  - Serves as navigation map for subsequent phases
  - Contains hierarchical sketch of containers/components from folder structure
  - Includes tickable progress lists for container/component analysis
  - Small template with comment-instructions for hierarchical sketching
- **Progress Tracking**: Use tickable lists in DISCOVERY.md to track analysis progress, go one-by-one and check off completed items
- **Integration Design**:
  - Add new "c4" template option to architecture templates in resources/templates/architecture/
  - Use existing setup_project_docs functionality in documentation_consolidation phase
  - Discovery notes file created directly in .vibe/docs/DISCOVERY.md (not via template system)
  - Final workflow call: `setup_project_docs({ architecture: "c4", requirements: "none", design: "comprehensive" })`
  - Support linking existing docs if discovered: `setup_project_docs({ architecture: "existing-doc.md", requirements: "none", design: "comprehensive" })`
- **Final Workflow Name**: "c4-analysis" - emphasizes the C4 methodology as the core differentiator
- **Workflow Description**: "A comprehensive workflow for analyzing legacy systems using C4 methodology. Progressively understand system architecture from context to components, with scope limiting for large codebases."
- **Separation of Concerns**: 
  - **Plan file**: Tracks progress with tasks and checkboxes
  - **Discovery file**: Long-term memory with comprehensive findings and insights
  - **Final state**: "analysis_complete" (not "enhancement_ready") since enhancements may not follow immediately

## Notes
- The workflow should be discovery-driven - we won't know the documentation state initially
- Must integrate with setup_project_docs for linking discovered/created documentation
- Should support the full lifecycle from understanding to renewal
- Context management is critical for large legacy codebases
- Each phase should focus on specific, limited scope to maintain manageable context
