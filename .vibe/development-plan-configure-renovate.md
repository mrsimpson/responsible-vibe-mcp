# Development Plan: responsible-vibe (configure-renovate branch)

*Generated on 2025-08-21 by Vibe Feature MCP*
*Workflow: [minor](https://mrsimpson.github.io/responsible-vibe-mcp/workflows/minor)*

## Goal
Configure Renovate to provide a frictionless dependency update experience with minimal manual intervention while maintaining code quality and stability.

## Explore
### Tasks
- [x] Analyze current project structure and dependencies
- [x] Identify existing Renovate configuration (if any)
- [x] Research frictionless Renovate best practices
- [x] Define requirements for automated dependency management
- [x] Design configuration approach for minimal friction

### Completed
- [x] Created development plan file
- [x] Analyzed project: Node.js/TypeScript project with npm, has basic renovate.json with config:recommended
- [x] Found existing CI/CD: GitHub Actions with PR validation (Node 18, 20, latest) and automated tests
- [x] Researched best practices for frictionless dependency management
- [x] Defined comprehensive requirements for automated updates
- [x] Designed configuration approach with auto-merge and grouping strategies

## Implement

### Completed
*None yet*

## Finalize

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [ ] Renovate configuration is implemented and tested
- [ ] Automated dependency updates are working as expected
- [ ] Configuration provides the desired frictionless experience
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate

### Tasks
- [ ] *To be added when this phase becomes active*

### Completed

## Key Decisions

### Current State Analysis
- **Project Type**: Node.js/TypeScript MCP server with npm package management
- **Dependencies**: Mix of production deps (@modelcontextprotocol/sdk, js-yaml, sqlite3, zod) and dev deps (vitest, typescript, etc.)
- **Current Renovate Config**: Basic setup with `config:recommended` preset only
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with PR validation across Node 18, 20, and latest versions
- **Testing**: Automated test suite with `npm run test:run`

### Frictionless Requirements Identified
- **Auto-merge capability** for low-risk updates (patch versions, dev dependencies)
- **Grouped updates** to reduce PR noise
- **Semantic commit messages** (project uses conventional commits)
- **Respect CI/CD pipeline** and only merge when tests pass
- **Schedule optimization** to avoid overwhelming maintainers

### Detailed Frictionless Requirements
1. **Auto-merge Strategy**:
   - Patch updates for production dependencies (auto-merge when CI passes)
   - All dev dependency updates (auto-merge when CI passes)
   - Minor updates for well-maintained packages (with approval)

2. **Grouping Strategy**:
   - Group dev dependencies together
   - Group patch updates together
   - Separate major updates for individual review

3. **Scheduling**:
   - Non-office hours to avoid interrupting development
   - Limit concurrent PRs to avoid overwhelming CI

4. **Safety Measures**:
   - Require status checks (CI must pass)
   - Respect package.json constraints
   - Use semantic commit messages for changelog generation

### Configuration Design Approach
- **Base**: Extend `config:recommended` (current setup)
- **Add**: Auto-merge presets for low-risk updates
- **Configure**: Grouping rules for related dependencies
- **Schedule**: Off-hours updates with PR limits
- **Customize**: Semantic commits and branch naming
