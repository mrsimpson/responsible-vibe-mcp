# Development Plan: responsible-vibe (fix-workflow-loading branch)

*Generated on 2025-10-14 by Vibe Feature MCP*
*Workflow: [bugfix](https://mrsimpson.github.io/responsible-vibe-mcp/workflows/bugfix)*

## Goal
Fix regression in webapp where uploading a workflow from a file does not load properly. The dev server is running at http://localhost:5173/responsible-vibe-mcp/workflows.html

## Reproduce
### Tasks
- [x] Navigate to the webapp at http://localhost:5173/responsible-vibe-mcp/workflows.html
- [x] Observe the console warning: "File upload functionality disabled - needs refactoring"
- [x] Click on "Upload YAML" button to confirm file chooser opens
- [x] Examine the source code to understand the issue
- [x] Identify the FileUploadHandler dependency issue
- [x] Document the exact steps to reproduce the problem

### Completed
- [x] Created development plan file
- [x] Confirmed the regression exists - file upload functionality is disabled
- [x] Located the source of the issue in WorkflowVisualizer.vue line 244
- [x] Analyzed the dependency chain: FileUploadHandler → WorkflowLoader → YamlParser + BundledWorkflows

## Analyze
### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] Bug has been successfully reproduced
- [x] Exact steps to trigger the issue are documented
- [x] Error messages or symptoms are captured
- [x] Environment details are recorded

### Tasks
- [x] Analyze the dependency chain: FileUploadHandler → WorkflowLoader → YamlParser
- [x] Compare old vs new approach in WorkflowVisualizer.vue
- [x] Identify what functionality is missing in the new simplified approach
- [x] Determine the minimal changes needed to restore file upload
- [x] Document the root cause analysis
- [x] Propose fix approach

### Completed
- [x] Identified root cause: FileUploadHandler disabled due to WorkflowLoader dependency
- [x] Analyzed old vs new architecture approaches  
- [x] Determined minimal fix: Create inline file upload handler using same pattern as existing loadWorkflow function
- [x] Proposed solution: Add file upload event listener that reads file, parses YAML, and renders workflow directly

## Fix

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] Root cause of the bug has been identified
- [x] Analysis of the problematic code is complete
- [x] Fix approach has been determined and documented

### Tasks
- [x] Implement inline file upload handler in WorkflowVisualizer.vue
- [x] Add file reading functionality using FileReader API
- [x] Add YAML parsing using existing parseYaml import
- [x] Add error handling for invalid files
- [x] Remove the warning message about disabled functionality
- [x] Test the fix with a sample workflow file

### Completed
- [x] Successfully implemented inline file upload handler
- [x] File upload functionality restored and working correctly
- [x] Tested with sample workflow file - uploads and renders properly
- [x] Console warning message removed
- [x] Error handling implemented for invalid files

## Verify

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] Bug fix has been implemented
- [x] Code changes address the root cause
- [x] Fix is ready for testing

### Tasks
- [x] Verify original bug is resolved (workflow upload works)
- [x] Test edge cases (empty files, large files, invalid YAML)
- [x] Verify existing functionality still works (dropdown selection)
- [x] Test error handling and user feedback
- [x] Verify no regressions in other parts of the application
- [x] Test file upload multiple times to ensure reliability

### Completed
- [x] Original bug resolved: Workflow upload works perfectly
- [x] Edge cases tested: Empty files and invalid YAML show proper error messages
- [x] Existing functionality verified: Dropdown selection works correctly
- [x] Error handling verified: Clear error messages displayed to user
- [x] No regressions found: All existing functionality intact
- [x] Reliability confirmed: Multiple uploads work consistently
- [x] File input resets properly after each upload
- [x] Console warning message completely removed

## Finalize

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] Bug fix has been verified and tested
- [x] No regressions have been introduced
- [x] Fix is confirmed to resolve the original issue

### Tasks
- [x] Remove any temporary debug output statements
- [x] Review and clean up the implemented code
- [x] Check for TODO/FIXME comments
- [x] Verify no experimental code remains
- [x] Final validation of the fix
- [x] Clean up temporary test files

### Completed
- [x] Code review completed - no unnecessary debug output or temporary code found
- [x] No TODO/FIXME comments requiring attention
- [x] Temporary test files cleaned up
- [x] Final validation successful - fix working correctly
- [x] Console warning message completely removed
- [x] All functionality verified as working properly

## Key Decisions
- **Root Cause Identified**: The file upload functionality was intentionally disabled due to a dependency issue with WorkflowLoader
- **Location**: `/packages/visualizer/src/WorkflowVisualizer.vue` line 244
- **Issue**: FileUploadHandler needs to be updated to not depend on WorkflowLoader
- **Analysis Complete**: 
  - Old approach: FileUploadHandler → WorkflowLoader → YamlParser (complex dependency chain)
  - New approach: Simple fetch() + parseYaml() directly in Vue component
  - Missing: File upload handler that matches the new simplified approach
  - Solution: Create inline file upload handler using same pattern as loadWorkflow function
- **Fix Implemented**: Inline file upload handler with FileReader API, YAML parsing, and comprehensive error handling
- **Verification Complete**: All functionality tested including edge cases, error handling, and reliability
- **Finalization Complete**: Code cleaned up, temporary files removed, final validation successful

## Notes
**Reproduction Steps:**
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/responsible-vibe-mcp/workflows.html
2. Open browser console and observe warning: "File upload functionality disabled - needs refactoring"
3. Click "Upload YAML" button - file chooser opens but functionality is disabled
4. No workflow is loaded even if a file is selected

**Technical Analysis:**
- The Vue component was refactored to use a simple `loadWorkflow` function with `fetch()` and `parseYaml()`
- The old FileUploadHandler depends on WorkflowLoader which has complex dependencies
- The new approach is simpler but the file upload wasn't updated to match
- File upload button exists in UI but the handler is not initialized (line 244 in WorkflowVisualizer.vue)
