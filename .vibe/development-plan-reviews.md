# Development Plan: responsible-vibe (reviews branch)

*Generated on 2025-07-28 by Vibe Feature MCP*
*Workflow: epcc*

## Goal
Add optional review mechanisms to the responsible-vibe-mcp system before phase transitions. Reviews can be conducted by LLMs (if tools are available) or through alternative perspectives as defined by workflows.

## Explore
### Tasks
- [ ] Analyze current phase transition mechanism in `proceed-to-phase.ts`
- [ ] Investigate available LLM interaction tools in MCP ecosystem
- [ ] Design review integration points in the workflow system
- [ ] Evaluate different review approaches (LLM-based vs workflow-defined)
- [ ] Define review configuration schema for workflows
- [ ] Consider user experience for optional vs mandatory reviews
- [ ] Analyze pros/cons of different review approaches for artifact and decision evaluation
- [ ] Define what constitutes "artifacts and decisions" per phase
- [ ] Design user preference system for review enablement
- [ ] Design review state management system (not-required, pending, performed)
- [ ] Define workflow YAML schema for review perspectives
- [ ] Explore how to pass previous phase artifacts to review system
- [ ] Design error handling for missing reviews in proceed_to_phase
- [ ] Design conduct_review tool interface and functionality
- [ ] Define validation logic for review_state parameter in proceed_to_phase
- [ ] Design conduct_review tool for both sampling and non-sampling MCP environments
- [ ] Define conduct_review tool parameters (target_phase instead of perspectives/prompts)
- [ ] Design instruction generation for LLM-conducted reviews vs automated reviews
- [ ] Generalize conduct_review return type to unified instructions-based approach
- [ ] Determine source and derivation of artifacts_to_review information

### Completed
- [x] Created development plan file
- [x] Examined current system architecture (state machine, transition engine, workflow YAML structure)
- [x] Identified key integration points: `proceed-to-phase.ts`, workflow YAML definitions, transition engine
- [x] Analyzed pros/cons of LLM-based, checklist-based, and hybrid review approaches
- [x] Defined artifacts and decisions that would be reviewed per phase
- [x] Explored user preference design options (global, per-workflow, runtime choice)
- [x] Clarified user requirements: conversation-level property, review-state parameter, workflow perspectives
- [x] Designed implementation approach with conversation state, YAML schema, and tool modifications
- [x] Corrected understanding: review_state as proceed_to_phase parameter, not global conversation state
- [x] Refined architecture to use simple boolean requireReviewsBeforePhaseTransition in conversation
- [x] Incorporated user refinements: fallback to user review, stateless conduct_review tool design
- [x] Designed enhanced proceed_to_phase validation with error-driven guidance for LLM
- [x] Revised conduct_review tool design for MCP environment adaptation (sampling vs non-sampling)
- [x] Defined environment-aware tool interface with instruction generation for most common case

## Review Perspectives Analysis

### Waterfall Workflow Review Perspectives:

**requirements → design:**
- business_analyst: "Review requirements completeness, clarity, and business value. Ensure all stakeholder needs are captured and requirements are testable."
- ux_expert: "Evaluate user experience implications and usability requirements. Ensure user needs and workflows are properly defined."

**design → implementation:**
- architect: "Review technical architecture, design patterns, and system integration. Ensure scalability, maintainability, and alignment with existing systems."
- security_expert: "Evaluate security considerations, data protection, and potential vulnerabilities in the proposed design."

**implementation → qa:**
- senior_software_developer: "Review code quality, best practices, and implementation approach. Ensure clean, maintainable, and efficient code."
- performance_engineer: "Assess performance implications, resource usage, and potential bottlenecks in the implementation."

**qa → testing:**
- security_expert: "Review security testing coverage, vulnerability assessments, and compliance with security standards."
- senior_software_developer: "Evaluate test coverage, code quality metrics, and readiness for comprehensive testing."

**testing → complete:**
- business_analyst: "Verify that all requirements have been met and business objectives are achieved."
- ux_expert: "Confirm user experience goals are met and the solution is user-friendly and accessible."

### EPCC Workflow Review Perspectives:

**explore → plan:**
- architect: "Review exploration findings and ensure comprehensive understanding of the problem space and existing system architecture."
- senior_software_developer: "Evaluate technical feasibility and identify potential implementation challenges or dependencies."

**plan → code:**
- architect: "Review implementation strategy, design decisions, and integration approach for soundness and maintainability."
- security_expert: "Assess security considerations and potential risks in the planned implementation approach."

**code → commit:**
- senior_software_developer: "Review code quality, best practices, testing coverage, and readiness for production deployment."
- performance_engineer: "Evaluate performance impact, resource efficiency, and scalability of the implemented solution."

### Bugfix Workflow Review Perspectives:

**reproduce → analyze:**
- senior_software_developer: "Review reproduction steps, test cases, and ensure the bug is properly understood and documented."
- performance_engineer: "Assess if the bug has performance implications or is related to resource usage issues."

**analyze → fix:**
- architect: "Review root cause analysis and ensure the proposed fix doesn't introduce architectural issues or technical debt."
- security_expert: "Evaluate if the bug has security implications and ensure the fix doesn't introduce new vulnerabilities."

**fix → verify:**
- senior_software_developer: "Review fix implementation, code quality, and ensure the solution properly addresses the root cause."
- performance_engineer: "Verify that the fix doesn't introduce performance regressions or new bottlenecks."

## Key Decisions
- **Integration Point**: Reviews will be integrated into the `proceed_to_phase` tool handler, allowing optional review steps before phase transitions
- **Configuration Approach**: Reviews will be configurable per workflow and per transition in the YAML workflow definitions
- **Review Types**: Support both LLM-based reviews (if tools available) and workflow-defined perspective reviews
- **Conversation-Level Property**: Simple boolean `requireReviewsBeforePhaseTransition` set when starting development
- **Review State Parameter**: `review_state` is a **required** parameter of `proceed_to_phase` tool: `not-required`, `pending`, `performed`
- **LLM Cannot Ignore**: By making it required, the LLM must explicitly provide the parameter and cannot ignore it
- **Default Behavior**: When reviews are not enabled, LLM should pass `'not-required'` explicitly
- **Enforcement**: `proceed_to_phase` validates review_state parameter against conversation requirement and workflow configuration
- **Selective Review Implementation**: Added review perspectives only to key transitions where reviews provide real value:
  - **Requirements/Design phases**: business_analyst + ux_expert (focus on completeness and user needs)
  - **Architecture/Planning phases**: architect + security_expert (focus on technical soundness and security)
  - **Implementation phases**: senior_software_developer + performance_engineer (focus on code quality and performance)
  - **Final transitions**: business_analyst + ux_expert (focus on requirement fulfillment and user experience)
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality works with explicit `review_state: 'not-required'` parameter
- **Test Coverage**: Updated all 154 tests to explicitly pass the required `review_state` parameter
- **Review Scope**: Focus on artifacts of the previous phase, but with full project context
- **Perspective Definition**: Workflows must specify review perspectives for each transition
- **Fallback Review**: If no review perspectives defined in workflow, LLM asks user to manually review
- **conduct_review Tool Design**: Adapts to MCP environment - returns actual results if sampling available, returns instructions for LLM if not
- **conduct_review Parameters**: Takes target_phase parameter and reads workflow configuration (not stateless as initially thought)
- **Review Results**: In non-sampling environments, review "results" are determined by user interaction guided by LLM perspectives
- **Unified Return Type**: conduct_review always returns instructions field, whether for guided review or automated findings
- **Artifact Discovery**: No artifacts_to_review field - LLM discovers artifacts using git status, conversation history, plan file analysis
- **Minimal Interfaces**: Keep all interfaces minimal - no optional parameters or unnecessary return information

## Notes
### Current System Architecture
- **State Machine**: YAML-based workflow definitions with states and transitions
- **Transition Engine**: Handles phase transitions and instruction generation
- **Tool Handlers**: `proceed-to-phase.ts` handles explicit phase transitions
- **Workflow Structure**: Each transition has trigger, target state, instructions, and transition reason

### Review Integration Options Identified
1. **LLM-Based Reviews**: Use external LLM tools for automated reviews with different perspectives
2. **Workflow-Defined Reviews**: Configure review criteria and perspectives in YAML workflows
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Combine both automated and workflow-defined reviews

### Technical Integration Points
- Modify `YamlTransition` interface to support optional review configuration
- Extend `proceed-to-phase.ts` to handle review steps before transitions
- Add review result evaluation logic to determine if transition should proceed

### Error Handling Correction
- If hasReviewPerspectives is false, no error message needed - transition proceeds normally with review_state: 'not-required'
