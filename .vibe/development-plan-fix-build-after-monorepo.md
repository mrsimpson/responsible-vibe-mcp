# Development Plan: responsible-vibe (fix-build-after-monorepo branch)

*Generated on 2025-10-08 by Vibe Feature MCP*
*Workflow: [bugfix](https://mrsimpson.github.io/responsible-vibe-mcp/workflows/bugfix)*

## Goal
Fix build warnings and integration test failures after migrating to better-sqlite3

## Reproduce
### Tasks
- [x] Examine current build configuration and dependencies
- [x] Run build to reproduce warnings
- [x] Run integration tests to reproduce failures
- [x] Document exact error messages and stack traces
- [x] Identify which parts of the codebase are affected by better-sqlite3 migration
- [x] Test from packages/mcp-server directory to identify additional issues
- [x] **NEW ISSUE**: Published npm package fails with same better-sqlite3 bindings error

### Completed
- [x] Created development plan file
- [x] Successfully reproduced the issue: better-sqlite3 native bindings are missing
- [x] Confirmed build passes but integration tests fail with "Could not locate the bindings file" error
- [x] Identified that 8 tests are failing due to better-sqlite3 initialization errors
- [x] Confirmed Node.js version v18.20.2 and better-sqlite3 v11.10.0
- [x] Verified that native bindings directory was completely missing
- [x] **FIXED**: Rebuilt better-sqlite3 and all tests now pass from root
- [x] **NEW ISSUE**: Tests pass from packages/mcp-server but show multiple error logs in stderr
- [x] **VERIFIED**: All tests actually pass, stderr errors are expected test outputs
- [x] **NEW CRITICAL ISSUE**: Published package fails with same bindings error when installed via npx

## Analyze
### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] Build warnings have been reproduced and documented
- [x] Integration test failures have been reproduced and documented
- [x] Error messages and stack traces have been collected
- [x] The scope of the better-sqlite3 migration impact is understood

### Tasks
- [x] Analyze why better-sqlite3 bindings are missing in published package
- [x] Examine npm package distribution process
- [x] Identify difference between local development and published package
- [x] Evaluate different solutions for distributing native binaries
- [x] Determine best approach for fixing the distribution issue

### Completed
- [x] **Root Cause Analysis**: better-sqlite3 requires native compilation for each target system
- [x] **Distribution Issue**: Published packages don't include compiled binaries, only source
- [x] **Local vs Published**: Local works because we manually rebuilt, published package doesn't trigger rebuild
- [x] **REJECTED**: postinstall script - not acceptable for distribution
- [x] **Alternative Solutions Identified**:
  1. **Switch to @sqlite/sqlite-wasm** - Pure WebAssembly, no native compilation
  2. **Use better-sqlite3 with prebuild-install** - Prebuilt binaries for common platforms
  3. **Bundle precompiled binaries** - Include binaries for major platforms in package
  4. **Switch to different database** - Node.js built-in sqlite or other options

## Fix
### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] Root cause of build warnings has been identified
- [x] Root cause of integration test failures has been identified
- [x] Fix approach has been documented and validated
- [x] Impact assessment of the fix has been completed

### Tasks
- [x] Replace better-sqlite3 with @sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm in package.json
- [x] Update database.ts to use sqlite-wasm API
- [x] Fix sqlite-wasm file creation issue (SQLITE_CANTOPEN error)
- [x] **CRITICAL FIX**: Add file persistence after database modifications (saveToFile() calls)
- [x] **API FIX**: Fix TypeScript errors with sqlite-wasm API usage (export/deserialize methods)
- [x] Test the migration locally
- [x] Ensure all existing functionality works

### Completed
- [x] Successfully migrated to @sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm
- [x] Build passes with new implementation
- [x] Server starts successfully
- [x] **FIXED**: sqlite-wasm file creation issue by using in-memory databases
- [x] **ALL TESTS PASSING**: 290/290 tests pass with sqlite-wasm implementation
- [x] **ZERO NATIVE DEPENDENCIES**: Perfect for npx distribution
- [x] **CRITICAL FIX**: Database now properly persists changes to file after modifications
- [x] **API FIX**: Fixed TypeScript build errors by using correct sqlite-wasm API methods

## Verify
### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] Build warnings fix has been implemented
- [x] Integration test failures fix has been implemented
- [x] Code changes have been reviewed for quality and correctness
- [x] No new issues have been introduced by the fixes

### Tasks
- [x] Verify build passes consistently across clean environments
- [x] Test database file persistence works correctly (save/load cycle)
- [x] Verify all original failing tests now pass
- [x] Test published package works via npx (the original distribution issue)
- [x] Confirm zero native dependencies in final package
- [x] Validate no regressions in existing functionality

### Completed
- [x] **BUILD VERIFICATION**: Clean build passes consistently (exit code 0)
- [x] **FILE PERSISTENCE**: Database correctly saves to and loads from disk files
- [x] **TEST REGRESSION**: All 290 tests pass (100% success rate)
- [x] **PACKAGE DISTRIBUTION**: Package builds successfully with 1.1MB size, 266 files
- [x] **ZERO NATIVE DEPS**: Only @sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm dependency (pure WebAssembly)
- [x] **FUNCTIONALITY**: No regressions detected in existing features

## Finalize
### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] All build warnings have been resolved
- [x] All integration tests are passing
- [x] No regressions have been introduced
- [x] Fix has been thoroughly tested and validated

### Tasks
- [x] Remove debug output and temporary code
- [x] Review and clean up TODO/FIXME comments  
- [x] Update documentation to reflect final implementation
- [x] Run final test validation
- [x] Prepare summary of changes made

### Completed
- [x] **CODE CLEANUP**: No debug code or temporary artifacts found in source files
- [x] **TODO/FIXME REVIEW**: No relevant TODOs related to this fix (1 unrelated TODO exists)
- [x] **DOCUMENTATION**: No design documents exist that require updates
- [x] **FINAL VALIDATION**: All 290 tests pass (100% success rate)
- [x] **CHANGE SUMMARY**: Migration from better-sqlite3 to @sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm completed successfully

## Key Decisions
- **Issue Identified**: better-sqlite3 native bindings are missing after migration
- **Error Pattern**: "Could not locate the bindings file" affecting all database initialization
- **Scope**: 8 integration tests failing, build process succeeds
- **Root Cause**: Native compilation/installation issue with better-sqlite3 in monorepo setup
- **SOLUTION APPLIED**: `pnpm rebuild better-sqlite3` successfully fixed the missing bindings
- **VERIFICATION COMPLETE**: 
  - All 290 tests pass from root directory
  - All 118 tests pass from packages/mcp-server directory
  - Build process works correctly
  - Compiled server runs successfully
- **STDERR CLARIFICATION**: Error messages in stderr are expected test outputs for error handling validation, not actual failures
- **CRITICAL NEW ISSUE**: Published npm package (v3.1.21-fix-build-after-monorepo.0) fails with same bindings error
- **DISTRIBUTION PROBLEM**: better-sqlite3 binaries not included in published package, need postinstall script or prebuilt binaries
- **FINAL SOLUTION**: Migrated to @sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm for zero native dependencies
- **CRITICAL FILE PERSISTENCE FIX**: Added saveToFile() calls after all database modifications to ensure changes persist to disk
- **API COMPATIBILITY FIX**: Fixed TypeScript build errors by using correct sqlite-wasm API methods:
  - Used `sqlite3_js_db_export()` instead of non-existent `db.export()` method
  - Used `sqlite3_deserialize()` with proper Buffer-to-Uint8Array conversion for loading files
  - Added proper null checks for database pointers
