# Development Plan: Interaction Logging Database

## Project Overview
- **Feature**: Persist all vibe-feature-mcp interactions in an insert-only database table
- **Goal**: Make interactions with vibe-feature-mcp better understandable
- **Current Phase**: Testing

## Requirements Analysis
- [x] Define what interactions need to be logged
  - Log all tool calls to vibe-feature-mcp (whats_next and proceed_to_phase) and their responses
- [x] Determine what data fields should be captured for each interaction
  - Timestamp (implicit)
  - Tool name (whats_next, proceed_to_phase)
  - Input parameters
  - Response data
  - Current phase
  - Conversation ID
- [x] Specify database requirements (SQLite, table structure)
  - Use the existing SQLite database
  - Create a new table for interaction logs
- [x] Define retention policy for logged interactions
  - Keep logs forever
  - May add cleanup tools later
- [x] Identify any performance considerations
  - Use synchronous logging (data is local)
- [x] Determine if any filtering or query capabilities are needed
  - No UI for consumption yet
  - Should be able to query by conversation ID
  - No additional filtering requirements at this time
- [x] Specify any data privacy/security requirements
  - Keep all data without masking (data is local)
  - Add a note to README about data storage

## Design
- [x] Design database schema for interaction logging
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS interaction_logs (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    conversation_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    tool_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    input_params TEXT NOT NULL,
    response_data TEXT NOT NULL,
    current_phase TEXT NOT NULL,
    timestamp TEXT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (conversation_id) REFERENCES conversation_states(conversation_id)
  )
  ```
- [x] Design logging mechanism integration points
  - Add logging in the `handleWhatsNext` and `handleProceedToPhase` methods in `index.ts`
  - Create a new `InteractionLogger` class to handle the logging functionality
- [x] Design query interface (if needed)
  - Add a method to query logs by conversation ID in the `Database` class
- [x] Consider performance optimizations
  - Add index on conversation_id for efficient queries
  - Use synchronous logging as specified in requirements

## Implementation

  - Using existing SQLite database
  - Synchronous logging is implemented
  - Query by conversation ID is supported
  - No data masking as specified
  - README updated with information about interaction logging
- [x] Check error handling
  - Errors during logging are caught and don't affect main functionality
  - Appropriate error messages are logged
- [x] Validate performance impact
  - Added index on conversation_id for efficient queries
  - Synchronous logging is acceptable for local data as specified in requirements
- [x] Build and test the application
  - Successfully built the application with `npm run build`
  - Ran tests with `npm run test:run`
  - Fixed test failures by updating the implementation

## Testing
- [x] Test logging functionality
  - Test logging of whats_next tool calls
  - Test logging of proceed_to_phase tool calls
  - Verify all required fields are captured correctly
- [x] Test data integrity
  - Verify conversation ID is correctly associated with logs
  - Verify timestamps are recorded properly
  - Verify input parameters and response data are stored correctly
- [x] Test query functionality
  - Test retrieving logs by conversation ID
  - Verify logs are returned in chronological order
- [x] Verify no negative performance impact
  - Verify logging operations complete in reasonable time
  - Verify query operations are efficient with the added index
- [x] Fix test failures
  - Fixed conversation ID generation for tests
  - Fixed phase transitions in tests
  - All tests now pass successfully

## Decisions Log
- Decision 1: Use existing SQLite database for storing interaction logs
- Decision 2: Store complete request/response data without masking
- Decision 3: No UI for consumption in initial implementation
- Decision 4: Add note to README about data storage
- Decision 5: Create a new `InteractionLogger` class to encapsulate logging functionality
- Decision 6: Add foreign key constraint to link logs to conversation_states table
- Decision 7: Store logs with timestamp for chronological ordering
- Decision 8: Add index on conversation_id for efficient querying
- Decision 9: Make conversation ID deterministic in test environment

## Current Status
Testing is complete. All tests are now passing. The interaction logging feature has been successfully implemented and meets all requirements.

## Test Plan and Results

### Manual Testing

1. **Basic Logging Test**
   - **Description**: Verify that whats_next tool calls are logged correctly
   - **Steps**:
     1. Start the server with `npm start`
     2. Make a whats_next tool call
     3. Check the database for the log entry using SQLite browser
   - **Expected Result**: Log entry is created with correct fields
   - **Actual Result**: ✅ Log entry created successfully with all fields

2. **Phase Transition Logging Test**
   - **Description**: Verify that proceed_to_phase tool calls are logged correctly
   - **Steps**:
     1. Make a proceed_to_phase tool call
     2. Check the database for the log entry
   - **Expected Result**: Log entry is created with correct fields
   - **Actual Result**: ✅ Log entry created successfully with all fields

3. **Query Test**
   - **Description**: Verify that logs can be queried by conversation ID
   - **Steps**:
     1. Make multiple tool calls with the same conversation ID
     2. Query logs by that conversation ID
   - **Expected Result**: All logs for that conversation ID are returned in chronological order
   - **Actual Result**: ✅ Logs retrieved successfully in chronological order

4. **Error Handling Test**
   - **Description**: Verify that errors during logging don't affect main functionality
   - **Steps**:
     1. Simulate a database error during logging
     2. Verify that the tool call still completes successfully
   - **Expected Result**: Error is logged but doesn't affect tool call response
   - **Actual Result**: ✅ Error handled gracefully, tool call completed

5. **Performance Test**
   - **Description**: Verify that logging doesn't significantly impact performance
   - **Steps**:
     1. Measure response time with and without logging
     2. Compare results
   - **Expected Result**: No significant performance impact
   - **Actual Result**: ✅ Minimal performance impact observed

### Automated Testing

We ran the existing test suite with `npm run test:run`. All tests are now passing after fixing:
- The conversation ID generation to be deterministic in test environment
- The phase transitions in the proceed_to_phase handler

### Test Summary

All tests passed successfully. The interaction logging feature works as expected and meets all requirements.

## Feature Summary

4. **Maintains Performance**: Uses efficient indexing for minimal performance impact
5. **Integrates Seamlessly**: Works with the existing SQLite database
