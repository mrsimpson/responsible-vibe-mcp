### Completed
- [x] Tool successfully refactored to resume_workflow
- [x] Handler method implemented with comprehensive functionality
- [x] Integration with conversation manager working
- [x] Plan file analysis implemented (tasks, decisions extraction)
- [x] Phase-specific recommendations implemented
- [x] Error handling implemented

## Quality Assurance

### Tasks
- [x] Write comprehensive unit tests for resume_workflow
- [x] Test comprehensive response format
- [x] Test integration with conversation state
- [x] Verify workflow resumption effectiveness
- [x] Test plan file analysis functionality

### Completed
- [x] Created comprehensive test suite with 12 test cases
- [x] All tests passing successfully (12/12)
- [x] Error handling verified
- [x] Plan file analysis tested
- [x] Integration confirmed working

## Testing

### Tasks
- [x] Unit tests for comprehensive tool functionality
- [x] Integration tests for resume_workflow
- [x] Manual testing of workflow resumption
- [x] Verify comprehensive context gathering

### Completed
- [x] All unit tests passing (12/12)
- [x] Manual testing confirmed comprehensive tool works correctly
- [x] Workflow resumption verified effective
- [x] Context gathering tested and working

## Decision Log

### Technical Decisions
- **Evolution**: Successfully evolved from get_system_prompt to resume_workflow for comprehensive context
- **Tool Interface**: Used include_system_prompt and simple_prompt parameters for flexible control
- **Integration**: Leveraged existing conversation state and plan file systems effectively
- **Response Format**: Structured response with workflow_status, plan_status, system_prompt, recommendations, and metadata
- **Phase Source**: Current phase comes from database (authoritative source), not plan file parsing

### Design Decisions
- **Comprehensive Approach**: Include system prompt, project state, plan status, and next steps in single tool
- **Context Gathering**: Integrate with conversation manager and plan manager for complete context
- **User Experience**: Single tool call provides everything needed to resume development
- **Plan Analysis**: Focus on tasks and decisions extraction, not phase detection
- **Recommendations**: Phase-specific guidance with immediate actions and potential issues

## Notes

### What resume_workflow Provides
1. **System Prompt**: Complete integration instructions (optional)
2. **Project Context**: Current path, branch, state machine type, conversation ID
3. **Development Phase**: Current phase from database (authoritative source)
4. **Plan File Status**: Key tasks, completed items, decisions, analysis
5. **Conversation State**: Current conversation context and metadata
6. **Recommendations**: Phase-specific next steps, immediate actions, potential issues

### Implementation Highlights
- Tool registered as `resume_workflow` with proper MCP annotations
- Handler method `handleResumeWorkflow()` with comprehensive functionality
- Plan file analysis focuses on tasks and decisions (not phase detection)
- Phase information comes from database (single source of truth)
- Comprehensive error handling and logging integration

### Usage Scenarios
- After conversation compression when complete context is lost
- Starting new development sessions to understand current state
- Debugging workflow issues with complete project visibility
- Onboarding to existing projects with full context

### Key Improvements Over get_system_prompt
- Comprehensive project context beyond just system prompt
- Current development state and progress information
- Plan file analysis with task and decision extraction
- Phase-specific recommendations and next steps
- Single tool provides complete workflow resumption

---

*This plan documents the successful evolution from a simple system prompt tool to a comprehensive workflow resumption tool that provides everything needed to continue development seamlessly after conversation compression.*
