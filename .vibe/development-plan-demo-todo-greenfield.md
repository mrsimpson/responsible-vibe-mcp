## Goal
Build a todo application that allows users to manage their tasks effectively

## Ideation
### Tasks
- [x] Define target users and their needs
- [x] Identify core features and functionality  
- [x] Research existing todo solutions and gaps
- [x] Define success metrics
- [x] Establish detailed project scope (what's in/out)
- [x] Define CLI interface and commands
- [x] Finalize edge case handling decisions
- [x] Create user personas and use cases
- [x] Document requirements in PRD

### Completed
- [x] Created development plan file

## Architecture

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] Requirements have been thoroughly defined and documented
- [x] User personas and use cases are clearly identified
- [x] Project scope is well-defined (what's in and out of scope)
- [x] Success metrics and acceptance criteria are established

### Tasks
- [x] Evaluate programming language options
- [x] Design CLI argument parsing approach
- [x] Design YAML file structure and operations
- [x] Define error handling strategy
- [x] Consider cross-platform compatibility
- [x] Design modular architecture
- [x] Document technical decisions in architecture.md

### Completed
*None yet*

## Plan

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] Technical architecture has been designed and documented
- [x] Technology stack has been selected with justification
- [x] System components and their interactions are defined
- [x] Non-functional requirements are addressed

### Tasks
- [ ] Create detailed implementation roadmap
- [ ] Break down development into phases
- [ ] Identify task dependencies and order
- [ ] Plan testing strategy
- [ ] Document detailed design specifications
- [ ] Organize coding tasks in Code section

### Completed
*None yet*

## Code

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [ ] Detailed implementation plan has been created
- [ ] Tasks are broken down into actionable items
- [ ] Dependencies and risks have been identified
- [ ] Development approach and patterns are defined

### Tasks
- [ ] *To be added when this phase becomes active*

### Completed
*None yet*

## Finalize

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [ ] Core functionality has been implemented
- [ ] All planned features are working as expected
- [ ] Code follows established patterns and standards
- [ ] Basic testing has been completed

### Tasks
- [ ] *To be added when this phase becomes active*

### Completed
*None yet*

## Key Decisions
- **Target User**: Personal use (developer who works primarily on command line)
- **Platform**: CLI application
- **Storage**: YAML file for human readability
- **Scope**: Minimal viable product - CRUD operations + task completion
- **Success Criteria**: Simple, fast, and usable from command line
- **Task IDs**: Incremental counter (never reused), returned from all interactions
- **Metadata**: Record creation date (stored but not displayed by default)
- **Completion**: Mark tasks as done, exclude from default list view
- **File Location**: ~/.todos.yaml
- **Edge Cases**: Graceful error handling, auto-file creation, stable ID management
- **Distribution**: Single multi-platform binary
- **Language**: Go (fast compilation, simple syntax, excellent standard library)

## Notes
*Additional context and observations*

*This plan is maintained by the LLM. Tool responses provide guidance on which section to focus on and what tasks to work on.*
