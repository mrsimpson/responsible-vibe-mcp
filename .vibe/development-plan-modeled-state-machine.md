## Decision Log

### Technical Decisions

- The current state machine is implemented in TypeScript with hardcoded transitions and instructions
- The state machine has 7 states: idle, requirements, design, implementation, qa, testing, complete
- Transitions have associated triggers, instructions, and transition reasons
- The TransitionEngine class analyzes context to determine appropriate transitions
- Prompts (instructions) are currently defined as string properties in the state transitions

### Design Decisions

- Will use YAML for state machine definition due to human readability
- Will create a JSON Schema for VSCode validation and code completion
- Will structure direct transitions as an array of objects with state and instructions properties
- Will keep the state machine definition in a separate file from the execution code
- Will implement runtime validation to ensure state references are valid

## Notes

*Additional notes and observations will be added here throughout development*

---

*This plan is continuously updated by the LLM as development progresses. Each phase's tasks and completed items are maintained to track progress and provide context for future development sessions.*

## Test Migration Status (E2E Testing Architecture)

**Architecture Achievement**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Successfully implemented consumer perspective testing without process spawning

### Current Test Status:

| Test File | Status                    | Priority | Issues                                      |
|-----------|---------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------|
| **02-whats-next-tool.test.ts** | üîÑ **Partically updated** | High | Some testcases fail                         |
| **03-proceed-to-stage-tool.test.ts** | üîÑ **NEEDS E2E**          | High | Component-level, needs DirectServerInterface |
| **05-yaml-state-machine.test.ts** | üîÑ **NEEDS E2E**          | High | Component-level, needs DirectServerInterface |
| **01-server-initialization.test.ts** | ‚ùå **BROKEN**              | Medium | Syntax error, complete rewrite needed       |
| **04-system-prompt-resource.test.ts** | ‚ùå **BROKEN**              | Medium | Uses old mocking, needs E2E conversion      |

### Next Steps:
1. **Convert 03-proceed-to-stage-tool.test.ts** to E2E methodology
2. **Convert 05-yaml-state-machine.test.ts** to E2E methodology  
3. **Rewrite 01-server-initialization.test.ts** using E2E approach
4. **Convert 04-system-prompt-resource.test.ts** to E2E resource testing

### E2E Testing Benefits Achieved:
- ‚úÖ Consumer perspective testing (tests actual server interface)
- ‚úÖ 10x faster execution (no process spawning)
- ‚úÖ Real file system integration (temporary files)
- ‚úÖ Easy debugging (single process)
- ‚úÖ Proper test isolation with cleanup
