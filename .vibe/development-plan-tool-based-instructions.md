- [x] Put all dynamic guidance in tool responses instead of plan file
- [x] Update tool descriptions to reference simple plan file structure
- [x] Test improved architecture with different workflows
- [x] **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**: All 96 tests passing

### Completed
- [x] Created development plan file
- [x] Fixed `transition_reason` confusion in `whats_next()` tool
- [x] Identified architectural inconsistency in tool descriptions
- [x] **MAJOR DECISION**: Chose Option A for plan file architecture
- [x] **IMPLEMENTATION**: Successfully implemented plan-file-centric architecture

## Decision Log

### Technical Decisions

**2025-06-26: Consistent Information Architecture Pattern**
- **Problem**: Information about workflows and phases was scattered across system prompt, tool descriptions, tool results, and plan files with inconsistent detail levels
- **Root Cause**: Static descriptions contained hardcoded workflow-specific information while actual workflows are chosen dynamically
- **Solution**: Plan-file-centric approach where all dynamic information lives in the plan file
- **Pattern**: Static descriptions stay generic + point to plan file for specifics
- **Benefits**: Workflow flexibility, single source of truth, user visibility, maintainable architecture

**2025-06-26: Removed `transition_reason` from `whats_next()` Response**
- **Problem**: `transition_reason` in `whats_next()` was confusing because the tool doesn't actually transition anything
- **Confusion**: Only `proceed_to_phase()` should have a `reason` parameter since it's the only tool that actually transitions
- **Solution**: Removed `transition_reason` field entirely from `whats_next()` response
- **Result**: Cleaner, less confusing tool interface

**2025-06-26: Plan File Architecture Decision - Option A Selected**
- **Problem**: Proposed complex plan file structure assumed tools could dynamically update plan content
- **Reality Check**: Tools have no intelligence to manipulate plan files - only LLM can update them
- **Options Considered**:
  - A: Simple plan file (task lists + decisions) + dynamic guidance in tool responses
  - B: Accept LLM manual maintenance of minimal structure  
  - C: Rethink plan-file-centric approach entirely
- **Decision**: **Option A** - Keep plan file very simple, put all dynamic guidance in tool responses
- **Rationale**: Maintainable by LLM, clear separation of concerns, reduces plan file maintenance burden
- **Implementation**: Plan file = task tracker + context only, tools provide all dynamic "what to do now" guidance
*Technical decisions will be documented here as they are made*

### Design Decisions
*Design decisions will be documented here as they are made*

## Notes

*Additional notes and observations will be added here throughout development*

*This plan is continuously updated by the LLM as development progresses. Each phase's tasks and completed items are maintained to track progress and provide context for future development sessions.*
