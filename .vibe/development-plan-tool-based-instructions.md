# Development Plan: responsible-vibe (tool-based-instructions branch)

*Generated on 2025-06-26 by Vibe Feature MCP*
*Workflow: waterfall*

## Project Overview

**Status**: Requirements Phase  
**Current Phase**: Requirements  
**Workflow**: From Specification down to test â€“ the historical way. Ideal for larger, design-heavy tasks with well-defined requirements

### Feature Goals
- [ ] *To be defined based on requirements phase*

### Scope
- [ ] *To be defined during requirements phase*

## Current Status

**Phase**: Requirements  
**Progress**: Starting development with Gathering and analyzing requirements

### Current Phase Tasks
- [ ] *Tasks will be added as they are identified*

### Completed
- [x] Created development plan file

## Requirements

*Gathering and analyzing requirements*

### Tasks
- [ ] *To be added after previous phases completion*

### Completed
*None yet*

## Design

*Designing technical solution*

### Tasks
- [x] Analyze current server.ts structure and identify refactoring opportunities
- [x] Design modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- [x] Define module structure and file organization
- [x] Design tool handler abstraction pattern
- [x] Design resource handler abstraction pattern
- [x] Design server configuration module
- [x] Design common helper utilities
- [x] Define TypeScript interfaces for new modules
- [x] Plan migration strategy to avoid breaking changes
- [x] Design tool response renderer for MCP protocol translation
- [ ] Finalize interface contracts between modules
- [ ] Review design for potential issues or improvements

### Completed
- [x] Identified key issues with current monolithic server.ts
- [x] Proposed new directory structure with server/ folder
- [x] Designed separation between tool handlers, resource handlers, and core server
- [x] Added tool response renderer to separate business logic from MCP protocol concerns
- [x] Defined clean interfaces for BusinessResponse and McpToolResponse
- [x] Established consistent error handling patterns

## Implementation

*Building the solution*

### Tasks
- [x] Create core types and interfaces (src/server/types.ts)
- [x] Implement response renderer for MCP protocol translation
- [x] Create server helper functions for common operations
- [x] Create base tool handler classes with error handling
- [x] Implement WhatsNext tool handler
- [x] Implement ProceedToPhase tool handler
- [x] Implement StartDevelopment tool handler
- [x] Implement ResumeWorkflow tool handler
- [x] Implement ResetDevelopment tool handler
- [x] Create tool handler registry
- [x] Implement resource handlers
- [x] Create resource handler registry
- [x] Create main server orchestrator
- [x] Update existing server.ts to use new architecture
- [ ] Update tests to work with new structure (3 minor test failures remaining)

### Completed
- [x] Established clean separation between business logic and MCP protocol
- [x] Created consistent error handling patterns across all handlers
- [x] Implemented base classes to reduce code duplication
- [x] Successfully refactored monolithic server.ts into modular architecture
- [x] Maintained backward compatibility with existing API
- [x] All core functionality working (93/96 tests passing)
- [x] Build process working correctly
