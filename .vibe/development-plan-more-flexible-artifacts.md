# Development Plan: responsible-vibe (more-flexible-artifacts branch)

*Generated on 2025-08-12 by Vibe Feature MCP*
*Workflow: [epcc](https://mrsimpson.github.io/responsible-vibe-mcp/workflows/epcc)*

## Goal
Enhance the kiro-inspired project documentation system to support linking existing files (like README.md) that already contain requirements/design/architecture information, rather than only creating new structured documents.

## Explore
### Tasks
- [x] Analyze current project documentation system architecture
- [x] Understand how existing files could be linked instead of creating new ones
- [x] Research common patterns in small projects (README-centric documentation)
- [x] Identify integration points for file linking functionality
- [x] Explore user experience for selecting existing vs creating new documents
- [x] Consider backward compatibility with existing template system
- [x] Design metadata persistence for linkage information
- [x] Explore file detection patterns (README.*, docs-folder files)
- [x] Design mixed scenario handling (create missing, link existing)

### Completed
- [x] Created development plan file
- [x] Analyzed current system: `setup_project_docs` tool creates structured docs in `.vibe/docs/`
- [x] Examined `ProjectDocsManager` and `TemplateManager` classes
- [x] Understood current workflow integration via variable substitution (`$ARCHITECTURE_DOC`, etc.)
- [x] Gathered detailed user requirements for file linking functionality
- [x] Explored database structure for metadata persistence (SQLite with conversation_states table)
- [x] Analyzed current tool parameter structure and dynamic enum building
- [x] Identified file detection patterns in project (README.md, docs/ folder)

## Plan

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] Current project documentation system is thoroughly understood
- [x] Requirements for file linking functionality are clearly defined
- [x] User experience approach is decided (enhanced tool parameters)
- [x] Technical integration approach is identified (symlinks + validation)
- [x] Backward compatibility strategy is defined (no breaking changes)

### Implementation Strategy

#### **Core Enhancement Approach**
Extend the existing `setup_project_docs` tool to accept file paths in addition to template names, using symlinks to maintain standard document paths while supporting existing file references.

#### **Implementation Phases**
1. **Parameter Validation Enhancement**: Extend validation to handle both templates and file paths
2. **File Detection System**: Create utilities to detect and suggest existing documentation files
3. **Symlink Management**: Implement symlink creation and management logic
4. **Tool Integration**: Update tool descriptions and start_development suggestions
5. **Testing & Validation**: Comprehensive testing of all scenarios

## Key Decisions

### Enhanced Solution: "None" Template Approach
**Decision**: Create "none" template for each document type with placeholder content that instructs LLM to use plan file instead
**Rationale**: 
- Provides granular control (users can disable specific document types)
- Cross-conversation persistence (setting survives across sessions)
- Clean integration with existing template system
- Clear LLM guidance through placeholder content
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

**Example Usage:**
```typescript
setup_project_docs({
  architecture: "arc42",      // Use template
  requirements: "none",       // Disable with placeholder
  design: "README.md"         // Link existing file
})
```

**Template Content Example:**
```markdown
# Requirements Placeholder

This is a placeholder document. The user has chosen not to maintain separate requirements documentation for this project.

**INSTRUCTIONS FOR LLM:**
- Use the current development plan file to specify requirements for ongoing development
- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE
- Reference requirements from the plan file context when needed
- Focus requirements discussion in the plan file's relevant sections
```

### Current System Analysis:
- **Current Approach**: Creates structured documents in `.vibe/docs/` using templates
- **Template System**: Supports arc42/freestyle for architecture, ears/freestyle for requirements, comprehensive/freestyle for design
- **Workflow Integration**: Uses variable substitution (`$ARCHITECTURE_DOC`, `$REQUIREMENTS_DOC`, `$DESIGN_DOC`) in workflow instructions
- **File Management**: `ProjectDocsManager` handles creation, validation, and path resolution

### User Requirements Understanding:
- **Problem**: Many small projects use README.md as central documentation hub
- **Need**: Support linking existing files instead of only creating new structured documents
- **Use Case**: Projects with README-centric documentation should be able to reference existing files

### Key Requirements Decisions:
1. **UX Approach**: Extend `setup_project_docs` to accept file paths directly for each parameter
   - Tool description should instruct users to select templates OR provide custom file paths
   - LLM can auto-detect existing files and suggest them
2. **File Detection**: Support README.* patterns and files from docs-folder
3. **Mixed Scenarios**: Create missing docs with templates while linking existing ones
4. **Multiple References**: Same file (e.g., README.md) can serve multiple document types
5. **Persistence**: ~~Store linkage information in conversation-independent metadata~~ **UPDATED: Use symlinks instead**
6. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing behavior unchanged (setup_project_docs only called if docs don't exist)

### Final Implementation Decisions:
1. **Parameter Validation**: Strict validation - either known template name or valid file path
2. **File Path Support**: All formats (absolute, relative, project-relative) that can be used as symlink targets
3. **Symlink Strategy**: Create symlinks in `.vibe/docs/` pointing to existing files - eliminates metadata storage need
4. **Tool Enhancement**: List common file patterns in description, enhance `start_development` to suggest existing files in failure response
5. **No Metadata Storage**: Symlinks make the linked files appear at standard paths, no database storage needed

## Notes

### Current System Strengths:
- Clean separation between project docs and workflow plans
- Template-based document creation with multiple format options
- Dynamic workflow integration via variable substitution
- Comprehensive error handling and validation

### Potential Integration Approaches:
1. **File Selection Mode**: Extend `setup_project_docs` to allow selecting existing files
2. **Hybrid Approach**: Support both template creation and file linking
3. **Configuration-Based**: Allow projects to configure document sources
4. **Auto-Detection**: Automatically detect and suggest existing documentation files

### Technical Implementation Design:

#### **1. Enhanced Tool Parameters**
- **Current**: `architecture: 'arc42' | 'freestyle'`
- **Enhanced**: `architecture: 'arc42' | 'freestyle' | string` (file path)
- **Detection**: Tool description instructs users to provide template names OR file paths
- **Validation**: Strict validation - either known template name or valid existing file path

#### **2. File Detection Strategy**
- **Patterns**: `README.*`, `ARCHITECTURE.*`, `DESIGN.*`, `REQUIREMENTS.*`
- **Locations**: Project root, `docs/` folder, `.vibe/docs/`
- **Auto-suggestion**: Enhanced `start_development` suggests existing files in failure response

#### **3. ~~Metadata Persistence~~ Symlink Strategy**
- **~~Storage~~**: ~~Add new table `project_document_links` to existing SQLite database~~
- **Symlinks**: Create symlinks in `.vibe/docs/` pointing to existing files
- **Benefits**: Files appear at standard paths, no metadata storage needed, works with existing system
- **Scope**: Project-level, persistent across conversations

#### **4. Mixed Scenario Handling**
- **Logic**: For each document type, check if parameter is template name or file path
- **Create**: Use template system for template names
- **Link**: Create symlink in `.vibe/docs/` for file paths
- **Validation**: Ensure linked files exist and are readable before creating symlinks

#### **5. Multiple References Support**
- **Same file**: README.md can serve as requirements, architecture, and design
- **Implementation**: Multiple symlinks pointing to same source file
- **Resolution**: Variable substitution points to symlink paths in `.vibe/docs/`

#### **6. Tool Description Enhancement**
- **Common Patterns**: List README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, DESIGN.md, etc. in tool description
- **Examples**: Show both template and file path usage examples
- **Auto-Detection**: `start_development` scans for common patterns and suggests in failure response
