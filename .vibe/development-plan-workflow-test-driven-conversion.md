# Development Plan: responsible-vibe (workflow-test-driven-conversion branch)

*Generated on 2025-08-15 by Vibe Feature MCP*
*Workflow: [epcc](https://mrsimpson.github.io/responsible-vibe-mcp/workflows/epcc)*

## Goal

## Key Decisions
- **Workflow Structure**: Create TWO independent workflows (not connected)
  - **Workflow 1**: "boundary-testing" - Focus on comprehensive test creation
  - **Workflow 2**: "big-bang-conversion" - Focus on actual system conversion with behavioral comparison
- **LLM Guidance Role**: Workflows instruct LLM to interview users and provide best practices
- **Business Domain Organization**: LLM applies common methodologies and interviews user for validation
- **Behavioral Comparison**: Part of big-bang workflow, not testing workflow
- **Best Practices**: LLM provides good practices with specific examples (sidecars, proxies, tracing)
- **Architecture Integration**: Use variables to reference architecture docs ($ARCHITECTURE_DOC), allow for missing docs
- **Success Criteria**: Focus on functional equivalence (same outputs for same inputs)
- **Technology Approach**: Tech-agnostic workflows supporting various migration scenarios
- **Deliverables Documentation**: Create .vibe/CONVERSION_PLAN.md as post-completion guidance (not progress tracking)
- **Final Phase Names**: "Validation" and "Conversion Readiness" approved
- **CONVERSION_PLAN.md Purpose**: Provide guidance for what to do after workflow completion, not track progress (development plan handles progress)
- **Template Implementation**: Templates must be embedded in transition instructions from previous phase (not default instructions)
- **Template Creation**: Transition instructions take precedence over default instructions, ensuring template creation
- **LLM Instructions**: Workflows contain explicit instructions for what LLM should do and what to interview from users

## Notes
### C4-Analysis Workflow Analysis
- **Structure**: 6 phases (discovery → context_analysis → container_analysis → component_analysis → documentation_consolidation → analysis_complete)
- **Key Features**: 
  - Scope limiting to prevent overwhelming analysis
  - Long-term memory via DISCOVERY.md file
  - Living documentation enhancement throughout phases
  - Progressive understanding from context to components
- **Integration Points**: Final documentation and DISCOVERY.md provide comprehensive system understanding
- **Output**: Comprehensive system documentation, enhancement recommendations, API testing strategy

### Test-Driven Big-Bang-Conversion Concept
- **Big-Bang**: Complete system replacement rather than gradual migration
- **Test-Driven**: Comprehensive test suite creation before conversion begins
- **Conversion**: Systematic transformation of legacy system to new technology stack
- **Goal**: Minimize risk through extensive testing while achieving complete technology transformation

### User Requirements Analysis
- **API Testing Central**: End-to-end interface tests are the workflow's heart
- **Complete System Recreation**: Aim to recreate the entire system, not just parts
- **Business-Semantic Grouping**: Tests should be organized by logical boundaries
- **Behavioral Equivalence**: Both systems must operate equally with comparison mechanisms
- **Architecture Integration**: Reference existing architecture docs from c4-analysis
- **Tech Agnostic**: Support various technology migration scenarios
- **Workflow Scope Limitation**: End at setup completion, not actual technical execution
  - **Rationale**: Technical execution (cutover, database migration, traffic switching) happens outside LLM conversations in production environments
  - **End State**: Regression tests pass on new implementation, validation mechanism is set up and ready

### Detailed Implementation Plan

#### Boundary-Testing Workflow Structure
**States**: architecture_analysis → interface_discovery → business_domain_analysis → test_strategy_design → test_suite_implementation → validation

**Key Features**:
- Reference $ARCHITECTURE_DOC with fallback to search
- LLM interviews user about business domain boundaries using DDD methodologies
- Tech-agnostic approach supporting various legacy systems
- Focus on functional equivalence testing

#### Big-Bang-Conversion Workflow Structure  
**States**: conversion_planning → target_architecture_design → behavioral_comparison_setup → implementation_strategy → parallel_implementation → conversion_readiness

**Key Features**:
- Behavioral comparison mechanism suggestions (sidecars, proxies, tracing)
- LLM provides best practices adapted to specific project context
- Creates CONVERSION_PLAN.md as final deliverable
- Ends at readiness, not actual execution

**Detailed States**:
1. **conversion_planning** - Strategy for complete system replacement, reference existing tests
2. **target_architecture_design** - Design new system architecture in target technology
3. **behavioral_comparison_setup** - LLM suggests comparison mechanisms, user validates approach
4. **implementation_strategy** - Plan new system implementation approach and timeline
5. **parallel_implementation** - Build new system while maintaining test compatibility
6. **conversion_readiness** - Validate new system, create CONVERSION_PLAN.md, prepare for cutover

#### Refined Implementation Approach

**Template Creation Pattern**:
- Embed complete CONVERSION_PLAN.md template in transition instructions from parallel_implementation → conversion_readiness
- Transition instructions take precedence over default instructions
- Template created before entering conversion_readiness state
- Default instructions in conversion_readiness reference the created template by path

**LLM Instruction Structure for Each State**:
1. **What to do**: Clear action items for the LLM
2. **What to interview**: Specific questions to ask the user
3. **Best practices**: Context-aware recommendations to provide
4. **Validation criteria**: How to validate user responses and progress
5. **Transition guidance**: When and how to move to next state

**Example Interview Patterns**:
- Business domain analysis: "Interview the user about logical boundaries using Domain-Driven Design principles"
- Behavioral comparison: "Ask the user about their infrastructure and suggest appropriate comparison mechanisms"
- Architecture integration: "If $ARCHITECTURE_DOC exists, reference it; otherwise guide user to find architecture documentation"

**Template Creation Strategy**:
- CONVERSION_PLAN.md created in transition to conversion_readiness state (big-bang-conversion workflow)
- Template includes complete structure with placeholders
- Default instructions in conversion_readiness guide LLM to fill template based on workflow progress
- Template serves as final deliverable for post-completion execution

#### CONVERSION_PLAN.md Template
- **Purpose**: Post-completion guidance for production execution
- **Implementation**: Template embedded in transition instructions from parallel_implementation → conversion_readiness
- **Content**: Test inventory, comparison setup, cutover procedures, rollback plans
- **Format**: Actionable checklist for operations teams
- **Reference**: Created during transition, referenced by path in conversion_readiness default instructions

#### Implementation Constraints and Patterns
- **Template Embedding**: Templates embedded in transition instructions (not default instructions)
- **Template Creation**: Transition instructions take precedence, ensuring template creation before state entry
- **LLM Instructions**: Each state contains explicit instructions for:
  - What the LLM should do in that phase
  - What questions to ask/interview from the user
  - What best practices to provide
  - How to validate user responses
- **Interview Patterns**: Structured question templates embedded in instructions
- **Best Practice Guidance**: Context-aware recommendations with examples embedded in instructions
