# Development Plan: responsible-vibe (ask-for-branch branch)

*Generated on 2025-07-02 by Vibe Feature MCP*
*Workflow: waterfall*

## Goal
Implement a feature that prompts users to create a new branch when they start development while on the main branch, improving development workflow and preventing direct commits to main.

## Requirements
### Tasks
- [x] Define when the branch prompt should appear (trigger conditions) - **When start_development is called while on main/master branch**
- [x] Specify the user interaction flow (prompt format and options) - **Send question in start_development response, don't create plan file**
- [x] Determine what happens after user responds (yes/no scenarios) - **Ask user to create branch and call start_development again**
- [x] Define the exact wording of the prompt message - **"You're currently on the main branch. It's recommended to create a feature branch for development. Propose a branch creation by suggesting a branch command to the user call start_development again."**
- [x] Determine if this applies to all workflows or specific ones - **All workflows**
- [x] Clarify if "main" branch detection should also include "master" branch - **Yes, both main and master**
- [x] System should suggest a git branch command to the user

### Completed
- [x] Created development plan file
- [x] Identified core enhancement goal
- [x] Clarified trigger condition and user flow
- [x] Finalized all requirement details

## Design

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] The requirements have been thoroughly defined
- [x] The scope is clear (what's in scope and out of scope)
- [x] User needs and goals are well understood
- [x] Success criteria are documented

### Tasks
- [x] Analyze current start_development tool handler architecture
- [x] Identify where to add branch detection logic
- [x] Design the branch prompt response structure
- [x] Plan integration with existing git branch detection
- [x] Design branch name suggestion algorithm - **Use feature/ prefix with simple branch name**
- [x] Plan error handling for edge cases - **Handle git detection failures gracefully**
- [x] Design the modified response flow - **Early return with prompt if on main/master**

### Completed
- [x] Analyzed StartDevelopmentHandler class structure
- [x] Found existing git branch detection in ConversationManager.getGitBranch()
- [x] Identified integration point in start_development tool

## Implementation

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] Technical design is complete and approved
- [x] Architecture decisions are documented
- [x] Technology choices are finalized
- [x] Implementation approach is clear

### Tasks
- [x] Modify StartDevelopmentHandler to detect main/master branch
- [x] Add branch name suggestion logic
- [x] Create special response structure for branch prompt
- [x] Update response flow to return prompt instead of normal response
- [x] Add error handling for git detection failures
- [x] Test the implementation with different scenarios

### Completed
- [x] Implemented branch detection in StartDevelopmentHandler.executeHandler()
- [x] Added getCurrentGitBranch() helper method
- [x] Added generateBranchSuggestion() helper method
- [x] Created branch-prompt response structure
- [x] Added comprehensive test suite with 5 test cases
- [x] Verified all existing tests still pass

## Qa

- [x] Security Review: Check for security vulnerabilities
- [x] Performance Review: Assess performance impact
- [x] UX Review: Evaluate user experience
- [x] Maintainability Review: Check code maintainability
- [x] Requirement Compliance: Verify all requirements are met

### Completed
- [x] TypeScript compilation successful - no syntax errors
- [x] Project builds without errors
- [x] All 101 tests pass including 5 new branch prompt tests
- [x] Security review passed - no vulnerabilities found
- [x] Performance review passed - minimal overhead, efficient implementation
- [x] UX review passed - clear messaging and helpful guidance
- [x] Maintainability review passed - clean, well-documented code
- [x] All requirements verified and implemented correctly

## Testing

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] Quality assurance is complete
- [x] Code review is finished
- [x] All QA issues are resolved
- [x] Code meets quality standards

### Tasks
- [x] Unit Testing: Verify individual component functionality
- [x] Integration Testing: Test interaction with existing system
- [x] Edge Case Testing: Test boundary conditions and error scenarios
- [x] User Acceptance Testing: Validate feature meets user needs
- [x] Regression Testing: Ensure existing functionality still works
- [x] Performance Testing: Verify performance impact is acceptable
- [x] Cross-Workflow Testing: Test with different workflow types

### Completed
- [x] Unit tests: 5 comprehensive test cases covering all scenarios
- [x] Integration tests: All 67 integration tests passed
- [x] Edge case coverage: Git failures, non-git repos, different branches
- [x] User acceptance: All requirements validated and met
- [x] Regression testing: All 101 tests passed, no regressions
- [x] Performance testing: Minimal impact verified
- [x] Cross-workflow testing: Works with all workflow types

## Complete

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] All tests pass successfully
- [x] Feature is fully validated
- [x] Documentation is complete
- [x] Feature is ready for delivery

### Tasks
- [x] Summarize accomplishments
- [x] Finalize documentation
- [x] Confirm feature readiness

### Completed
- [x] **Feature Successfully Implemented**: Branch prompt enhancement is fully functional
- [x] **All Requirements Met**: Every user requirement has been implemented and validated
- [x] **Comprehensive Testing**: 101 tests passed including 5 new branch prompt tests
- [x] **Quality Assurance**: Security, performance, UX, and maintainability reviews all passed
- [x] **Documentation Complete**: Full development plan with all phases documented

## Key Decisions
- **Trigger condition**: Detect main/master branch in start_development tool
- **Response approach**: Return prompt message instead of normal start_development response
- **No plan file creation**: Skip plan file creation when prompting for branch
- **Branch suggestion**: Include git command suggestion in the response
- **Universal application**: Apply to all workflows without exception
- **Integration point**: Modify StartDevelopmentHandler.executeHandler() method
- **Branch detection**: Use existing ConversationManager.getGitBranch() method
- **Suggested branch naming**: Use "feature/" prefix with descriptive name
- **Response structure**: Return special response type with prompt message and git command
