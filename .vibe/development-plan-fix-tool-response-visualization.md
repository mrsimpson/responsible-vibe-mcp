# Development Plan: responsible-vibe (fix-tool-response-visualization branch)

*Generated on 2025-07-09 by Vibe Feature MCP*
*Workflow: bugfix*

## Goal
Fix the JSON conversation visualization bug where tool_use messages that return responses need to be properly visualized as messages in the conversation flow.

## Reproduce
### Tasks
- [x] Understand the current JSON conversation structure from sample data
- [ ] Identify how tool_use messages with responses should be displayed
- [ ] Get clarification on current vs expected behavior from user
- [ ] Create test cases that demonstrate the visualization issue
- [ ] Document the expected vs actual behavior

### Completed
- [x] Created development plan file
- [x] Received sample JSON data showing the issue
- [x] Analyzed sample data structure (ToolUseResults vs Response messages)

## Analyze
### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [ ] The bug has been reliably reproduced
- [ ] Test cases demonstrate the visualization issue
- [ ] Expected vs actual behavior is clearly documented
- [ ] Sample data structure is fully understood

### Tasks
- [ ] Examine the code responsible for JSON conversation visualization
- [ ] Identify where tool_use response handling is missing or incorrect
- [ ] Understand the data structure of tool_use messages with responses
- [ ] Map out the code path that needs modification

### Completed
*None yet*

## Fix
### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [ ] Root cause of the visualization bug has been identified
- [ ] Code paths requiring modification are mapped out
- [ ] Data structure handling requirements are understood
- [ ] Fix approach has been determined

### Tasks
- [ ] Implement proper handling for tool_use messages with responses
- [ ] Ensure responses are visualized as proper messages
- [ ] Test the fix with the sample data provided
- [ ] Verify the fix doesn't break existing functionality

### Completed
*None yet*

## Verify
### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [ ] Bug fix has been implemented
- [ ] Initial testing shows the fix works with sample data
- [ ] No obvious regressions in existing functionality
- [ ] Fix is ready for comprehensive verification

### Tasks
- [ ] Test with various tool_use response scenarios
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing conversation visualization
- [ ] Confirm the fix handles edge cases properly
- [ ] Document the solution for future reference

### Completed
*None yet*

## Key Decisions
- Initial decision: Focus on tool_use messages that return responses in JSON conversation visualization
- Sample data shows ToolUseResults structure with tool_use_id and content arrays
- Identified two distinct message types: ToolUseResults and Response messages

## Notes
- Sample data shows tool_use_results with ToolUseResults structure
- Need to handle both successful and potentially failed tool responses
- Visualization should treat tool responses as proper conversation messages
- Data structure includes: tool_use_id, content array with Text field, status field
- ToolUseResults messages have different structure than Response messages
- Sample shows empty Text content in tool result - need to handle this edge case
