# Development Plan: responsible-vibe (fix-startup-error-q-cli branch)

*Generated on 2025-09-17 by Vibe Feature MCP*
*Workflow: [bugfix](https://mrsimpson.github.io/responsible-vibe-mcp/workflows/bugfix)*

## Goal
Fix MCP server initialization issue where logger.info calls prevent Amazon Q CLI from loading the server

## Reproduce
### Tasks
- [x] Identify the problematic logger.info call location
- [x] Understand the MCP initialization sequence
- [x] Reproduce the error scenario

### Completed
- [x] Created development plan file
- [x] Found the issue: logger.info call on line 227 in src/index.ts happens BEFORE MCP server.connect()
- [x] Confirmed the commented-out logger.info on line 244 was the fix attempt

## Analyze
### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] Bug has been reliably reproduced
- [x] Error conditions and symptoms are documented
- [x] Environment details are captured

### Tasks
- [x] Analyze the MCP server initialization sequence
- [x] Identify all logging calls that happen before initialization completes
- [x] Determine the safest fix approach (move logging vs suppress logging)
- [x] Evaluate impact on debugging and troubleshooting

### Completed
- [x] Found problematic logger.info on line 227 in src/index.ts (before server.connect())
- [x] Found additional logger.info on line 83 in src/server/index.ts (during server.initialize())
- [x] Confirmed MCP protocol allows logging during initialization, but Amazon Q CLI expects initialize response first
- [x] Identified three fix approaches: suppress, delay, or move logging

## Fix
### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] Root cause has been identified
- [x] Fix approach has been determined
- [x] Impact assessment is complete

### Tasks
- [x] Test the fix with Amazon Q CLI - FAILED: logging still happens too early

### Completed
- [x] Remove logger.info call from line 227 in src/index.ts (before server.connect())
- [x] Remove logger.info call from line 83 in src/server/index.ts (during server.initialize())
- [x] Add single logger.info call after server.connect() completes - REMOVED: still too early
- [x] Completely suppress startup logging to ensure Amazon Q CLI compatibility

### Completed
*None yet*

## Verify
### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [ ] Fix has been implemented
- [ ] Code changes are complete
- [ ] Fix addresses the root cause

### Tasks
- [ ] *To be added when this phase becomes active*

### Completed
*None yet*

## Finalize
### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [ ] Fix has been verified to work
- [ ] No regressions have been introduced
- [ ] All tests pass

### Tasks
- [ ] *To be added when this phase becomes active*

### Completed
*None yet*

## Key Decisions
- **Root Cause Confirmed**: According to MCP specification, "The server SHOULD NOT send requests other than pings and logging before receiving the initialized notification."
- **Error Pattern**: `expect initialized response, but received: Some(Notification(JsonRpcNotification { ... LoggingMessageNotification ...}))`
- **Timing Issue**: The logger.info call on line 227 happens BEFORE the client sends the `initialized` notification, violating MCP protocol
- **MCP Protocol Flow**: 1) Client sends `initialize` request → 2) Server responds → 3) Client sends `initialized` notification → 4) Normal operations begin
- **Logging Allowed**: Servers CAN send logging notifications during initialization, but Amazon Q CLI implementation appears to expect the initialize response first
- **Analysis Complete**: Two problematic logging calls identified:
  - Line 227 src/index.ts: `logger.info('Starting Vibe Feature MCP Server'...)` - happens before server.connect()
  - Line 83 src/server/index.ts: `logger.info('ResponsibleVibeMCPServer initialized successfully')` - happens during server.initialize()
- **Fix Approach Revised**: Even after server.connect() completes, Amazon Q CLI still expects no logging until the full MCP handshake finishes. Completely suppressed startup logging to ensure compatibility.
