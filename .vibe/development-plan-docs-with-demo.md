# Development Plan: responsible-vibe (docs-with-demo branch)

*Generated on 2025-10-02 by Vibe Feature MCP*
*Workflow: [minor](https://mrsimpson.github.io/responsible-vibe-mcp/workflows/minor)*

## Goal
Enhance documentation (README.md and docs/readme) by adding an interactive demo with a placeholder image that opens a full-width overlay containing an iframe to the demo at https://agentic-rpl.netlify.app/conversation?url=https://github.com/mrsimpson/responsible-vibe-mcp/tree/demo-todo-greenfield/examples/greenfield-todo

## Key Decisions
- **Documentation Framework**: VitePress (TypeScript config)
- **Target Files**: README.md (root) and docs/README.md 
- **Placeholder Image**: docs/images/placeholder-demo-greenfield.png (confirmed exists)
- **Demo URL**: https://agentic-rpl.netlify.app/conversation?url=https://github.com/mrsimpson/responsible-vibe-mcp/tree/demo-todo-greenfield/examples/greenfield-todo
- **Approach**: HTML/CSS/JS overlay solution with play button over placeholder image
- **Implementation**: Inline styles for minimal dependencies, responsive design with max-width 600px
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard ESC support, focus management, proper alt text
- **Image Paths**: Relative paths adjusted for each README location (docs/ vs images/)
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Simple link with target="_blank" for root README, Vue component for VitePress docs

## Notes
**Technical Approach:**
- Create a clickable container with the placeholder image and a centered play button overlay
- On click, show a full-screen modal with the iframe
- Use minimal CSS for styling (no external dependencies)
- Ensure responsive design for mobile/tablet
- Include close button (X) and ESC key support
- Lazy load the iframe only when opened for performance

**Placement Strategy:**
- Position after the "Quick Start" section in both README files
- Use a dedicated section like "## ðŸŽ¬ See It In Action" 
- Keep consistent styling between root README and docs README

**Accessibility Considerations:**
- Proper ARIA labels for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management when modal opens/closes
- Alt text for placeholder image
