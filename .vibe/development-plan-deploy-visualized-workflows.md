# Development Plan: responsible-vibe-mcp (deploy-visualized-workflows branch)

*Generated on 2025-07-26 by Vibe Feature MCP*
*Workflow: minor*

## Goal
Set up GitHub Pages deployment for the workflow visualizer static site, enabling public access to the interactive workflow state machine visualization tool.

## Explore

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] Development workflow has been initiated

### Tasks
- [x] Analyze current workflow visualizer structure and build process
- [x] Research GitHub Pages deployment requirements
- [x] Identify what needs to be configured for static site deployment
- [x] Design deployment strategy and workflow

### Completed
- [x] Created development plan file
- [x] Analyzed workflow visualizer: Vite-based TypeScript app with D3.js, builds to `dist/` folder with static assets
- [x] Confirmed build process works: `npm run build` generates production-ready static files
- [x] Researched GitHub Pages: supports static site deployment via GitHub Actions or branch-based deployment
- [x] Identified deployment strategy: GitHub Actions workflow for automated building and deployment

## Implement

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] GitHub Pages deployment requirements are understood
- [x] Current build process has been analyzed
- [x] Deployment strategy has been designed (VitePress multi-page site)
- [x] All necessary configuration steps have been identified

### Tasks
- [x] Set up VitePress in docs/ directory
- [x] Convert README.md to VitePress index page
- [x] Create /workflows page with embedded visualizer
- [x] Convert workflow visualizer to Vue component
- [x] Set up VitePress GitHub Actions deployment
- [x] Test build and deployment process

### Completed
- [x] Created VitePress documentation site in `docs/` directory
- [x] Configured VitePress to use existing README.md as index page via rewrites
- [x] Created `/workflows` page with embedded Vue component for visualizer
- [x] Built Vue component that wraps existing TypeScript workflow visualizer
- [x] Set up GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment to GitHub Pages
- [x] Successfully tested VitePress build process - generates static site

## Key Decisions
1. **Site Architecture**: **REVISED** - Use VitePress instead of plain Vite for multi-page documentation site
2. **Content Structure**: Workflow visualizer as `/visualizer/` page, README as landing page, future docs as additional pages
3. **Path Strategy**: VitePress file-based routing: `index.md` → `/`, `visualizer.md` → `/visualizer/`
4. **Migration Approach**: Integrate existing workflow visualizer as Vue component within VitePress
5. **Deployment Method**: VitePress GitHub Actions workflow with built-in GitHub Pages support
