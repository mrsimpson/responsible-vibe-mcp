## Instructions for Use

**Purpose**: This file serves as the comprehensive long-term memory for the C4 analysis workflow. All findings, insights, and discoveries should be recorded here for future reference.

**For the LLM**: 
- **During Discovery**: Fill in system overview, technology stack, and initial architecture sketch
- **During Context Analysis**: Add context findings to the Context Level section
- **During Container Analysis**: Document container findings in the Container Level section
- **During Component Analysis**: Add detailed component analysis to the Component Level section
- **Throughout**: Add insights, observations, technical debt, and improvement opportunities as discovered

**Long-term Memory**: This file preserves all analysis findings and serves as the knowledge base for future development work. Unlike the plan file (which tracks progress), this file maintains the comprehensive understanding of the system.

**Reference**: This file should be referenced throughout the workflow and used as input for the final documentation consolidation phase.
