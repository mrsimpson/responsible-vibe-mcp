# Development Plan: responsible-vibe (fix-docs branch)

*Generated on 2025-10-09 by Vibe Feature MCP*
*Workflow: [minor](https://mrsimpson.github.io/responsible-vibe-mcp/workflows/minor)*

## Goal
Add GitHub Flavored Markdown rendering for code blocks in the workflow-visualizer component

## Explore
### Completed
- [x] Created development plan file
- [x] Analyze current workflow-visualizer implementation
- [x] Identify where code blocks are currently rendered
- [x] Research GitHub Flavored Markdown rendering options
- [x] Design minimal implementation approach

## Implement

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] Current code block rendering approach is understood
- [x] GitHub Flavored Markdown rendering solution is identified
- [x] Implementation approach is designed and documented

### Completed
- [x] Add marked dependency to package.json
- [x] Import marked library in WorkflowVisualizer.vue
- [x] Create markdown rendering function
- [x] Replace plain text code blocks with markdown-rendered HTML
- [x] Test the implementation
- [x] Verify existing functionality still works

## Finalize

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] Code blocks are rendering as GitHub Flavored Markdown
- [x] Implementation is tested and working
- [x] No existing functionality is broken

### Tasks
- [ ] *To be added when this phase becomes active*

### Completed
*None yet*

## Key Decisions
- Current implementation: Code blocks are rendered as plain text in `<div class="code-block">` elements
- Code blocks are used in 3 places: state default_instructions, transition instructions, and transition additional_instructions
- Current styling: monospace font, gray background, basic padding and borders
- No markdown processing currently exists in the visualizer
- **Solution chosen**: Use `marked` library (16.4.0) - lightweight, fast, and supports GitHub Flavored Markdown
- **Implementation approach**: 
  1. Add marked as dependency
  2. Create a simple markdown rendering function
  3. Replace direct text insertion with markdown-rendered HTML
  4. Maintain existing CSS styling for code-block class

## Notes
- WorkflowVisualizer.vue is the main component at `/packages/visualizer/src/WorkflowVisualizer.vue`
- Code blocks are rendered using template literals with `${content}` directly inserted
- Current dependencies: Vue 3.4.0, d3, js-yaml - no markdown libraries
- Need to add markdown processing while maintaining existing styling
- Marked library is MIT licensed and actively maintained
