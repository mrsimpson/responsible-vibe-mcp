Perfect! I'm now in the Explore phase of the EPCC workflow. Let me help you develop a compelling Slidev pitch
deck for your software product.

To create an effective pitch deck, I need to understand several key aspects about your software product and
presentation goals. Let me start by gathering this information:

## Key Questions for Exploration:

About Your Software Product:
1. What is your software product? What problem does it solve?
2. Who is your target audience/market?
3. What are the key features and benefits?
4. What makes it unique compared to competitors?
5. Do you have any existing branding, logos, or visual assets?

About Your Pitch:
1. Who will be your audience for this pitch? (investors, customers, partners, etc.)
2. How long should the presentation be?
3. What's your main goal? (funding, sales, partnerships, etc.)
4. Do you have any specific content or data you want to include?

About Design Preferences:
1. Do you have any preferred color schemes or visual styles?
2. Should it be more corporate/professional or creative/modern?
3. Any specific themes or visual metaphors that represent your product?

Technical Considerations:
1. Are you familiar with Slidev, or is this your first time using it?
2. Do you need interactive elements, animations, or just static slides?
3. Will you be presenting live or sharing the deck digitally?

Let me update the plan file with initial exploration tasks:

Excellent! I've completed a thorough exploration of your seal.codes project and requirements. Based on my
analysis, I have a clear understanding of:

## What I've Discovered:

About seal.codes:
• Revolutionary approach to digital authenticity using QR code attestations
• Bridges ancient trust concepts (royal seals) with modern technology
• Uses social identity providers instead of complex PKI
• Privacy-first: documents never leave user's device
• Built with 88% AI assistance - showcases genuine innovation

About Your Presentation:
• Target: Hackathon judges evaluating innovation and utility
• Goal: Demonstrate incredible usefulness and innovation
• Style: Modern, visual-heavy, minimal text per slide
• Format: Full-page visuals with detailed speaker notes
• Narrative: Trust problem → elegant solution → transformative impact

About Your Existing Work:
• You have a solid foundation in slides.md with the trust narrative
• STORYBOOK.md provides excellent visual storytelling concepts
• The "digital handshake" and "visible seal" metaphors are powerful

## Final Exploration Questions:

Before we move to the planning phase, I need to clarify a few remaining details:

1. Presentation Length: How many minutes do you have for the pitch? (This affects slide count and pacing)

2. Visual Assets: Do you have access to:
   • The seal.codes logo/branding assets?
   • Any screenshots of the actual application in use?
   • The images referenced in your current slides.md (handshake.png, logo.svg, etc.)?

3. Interactive Elements: Should this be a static presentation, or would you like any interactive demos/
animations during the pitch?

4. Specific Hackathon Context: Are there particular judging criteria or themes the hackathon emphasizes that we
should highlight?

5. Technical Demo: Do you want to include a brief live demo of seal.codes, or keep it purely conceptual?

Once I have these final details, I'll be ready to transition to the planning phase where we'll create a
detailed slide-by-slide structure and implementation strategy. The exploration has given us a strong foundation
- seal.codes is genuinely innovative and has a compelling story to tell!
[vibe] !> Duration max. 8 minutes
I have put some assts I#ve already got in the public folder (including screenshots). You can guess the meaning from their filename.
The presentation shall be static. I might use full-page video (I generated it already) to add movement.
If you imagine additional images for illustrations, describe them as prompt to an LLM to generate it

Great! Let me continue refining the implementation plan. I'll work on the remaining planning tasks to create a
comprehensive blueprint for the Slidev implementation.

## **SPEAKER NOTES FRAMEWORK**

Let me define the detailed speaker notes structure for each slide:

### **Slide 1: Title/Cover (30 seconds)**
Speaker Notes: "Thank you for your time today. I want to talk about something we all engage in every single
moment of our lives: human interaction. And at the heart of every interaction lies one fundamental element -
trust. Today I'll show you how we're bringing that trust back to our digital world with seal.codes."

### **Slide 2: Foundation of Trust (30 seconds)**
Speaker Notes: "What makes us as humans so unique is the intricate way we interact. We build societies, create
art, and conduct business. And every single one of these interactions, from a simple conversation to a global
transaction, is built on a fundamental, invisible foundation: Trust."

### **Slide 3: Ancient Wisdom (30 seconds)**
Speaker Notes: "For millennia, humans solved this with visible marks of authenticity. Royal seals pressed into
wax instantly communicated who stood behind a document and protected against unauthorized modifications. These
weren't just decorative - they were the foundation of commerce, law, and society."

### **Slide 4: Digital Chaos (30 seconds)**
Speaker Notes: "But in the digital space, that foundation is crumbling. The very openness that allows us to
connect globally has also created a crisis of trust. We are constantly forced to ask: Is this real? Is this
authentic? Who is truly behind this? The traditional signals of trust have been lost in a sea of anonymous,
easily duplicated content."

### **Slide 5: Creator's Dilemma (35 seconds)**
Speaker Notes: "This is Sarah. She's a creator. Her interaction with the world is through her art. But when her
work is stolen and her ownership is erased, the trust between her and her audience is broken. She loses
credit, income, and the digital world loses a piece of its integrity. This happens millions of times every
day."

### **Slide 6: Buyer's Gamble (35 seconds)**
Speaker Notes: "This is Alex. His interaction is a transaction—he wants to buy something online. But the
digital marketplace is filled with doubt. He's forced to gamble, unsure if a seller is legitimate or a scam.
This lack of trust creates friction, prevents commerce, and costs billions in fraud annually."

### **Slide 7: Expert's Curse (30 seconds)**
Speaker Notes: "For decades, brilliant minds have tried to solve this. We've had cryptographic solutions like
PGP and complex Trust Chains with PKI. But these tools have a fatal flaw: they were built by experts, for
experts. They require complex setup, key management, and a level of technical understanding that puts them out
of reach for almost everyone."

### **Slide 8: Digital Seals Solution (35 seconds)**
Speaker Notes: "seal.codes was created to solve this. We believe the solution isn't to build more complex
systems, but to return to the simple clarity of a visible mark of trust. We're bringing the simple, elegant
concept of the seal to the digital age - but powered by modern technology."

### **Slide 9: How It Works (40 seconds)**
Speaker Notes: "Here's how simple it is: Upload your document, login with a social account you already have -
Google, GitHub, whatever you use - and get your digital seal. That's it. No private keys, no certificates, no
technical complexity. The seal embeds directly into your document as a QR code that anyone can verify."

### **Slide 10: Verification Result (35 seconds)**
Speaker Notes: "When someone receives your document, they simply scan the QR code. They instantly see who
created it, when it was sealed, and can verify it hasn't been tampered with. It's like having a digital
handshake embedded right in your content."

### **Slide 11: Sarah's Success (30 seconds)**
Speaker Notes: "Now Sarah can embed a visible, verifiable seal directly onto her work. She's not just
protecting her art; she's proudly declaring, 'This is mine. I stand behind it.' She's restoring the trust in
her creative interactions, and her audience knows they're seeing authentic work."

### **Slide 12: Alex's Confidence (30 seconds)**
Speaker Notes: "The seal acts as Alex's digital handshake. By scanning it, he can instantly verify that the
seller is real and legitimate. It removes the doubt, prevents the fraud, and allows a trusted transaction to
take place, just as it would in the physical world."

### **Slide 13: Innovation Showcase (35 seconds)**
Speaker Notes: "This isn't just another app - this represents genuine innovation. Built with 88% AI assistance
using bolt.new, seal.codes demonstrates what's possible when we combine human creativity with AI capability. We
didn't build another todo app or social network clone - we solved a fundamental problem that's existed since
the dawn of the internet."

### **Slide 14: The Vision (30 seconds)**
Speaker Notes: "Our vision isn't to create yet another complex, centralized platform. It's about empowerment.
It's about giving every user the ability to leverage the social identities they already have to prove ownership
and authenticity. We're putting the power of a trusted seal back into the hands of the individual."

### **Slide 15: Call to Action (20 seconds)**
Speaker Notes: "We invite you to help us restore trust to our digital world. seal.codes - Add a seal. Share

## **SLIDEV LAYOUTS AND COMPONENTS PLAN**

### **Layout Strategy:**
• **Cover Layout**: For impactful full-screen moments (slides 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15)
• **Image-Right Layout**: For character stories and product demos (slides 5, 6, 10, 11, 12)
• **Image-Left Layout**: For process explanation (slide 9)

### **Component Requirements:**
• **Custom video backgrounds** for slides 2 and 3
• **Responsive image handling** for all product screenshots
• **Custom typography** for minimal text approach
• **Smooth transitions** between slides
• **Presenter mode optimization** for speaker notes

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## **CUSTOM STYLING AND THEME APPROACH**

### **Design System:**
• **Color Palette**: Derived from seal.codes branding (likely modern blues/grays)
• **Typography**: Clean, modern sans-serif for readability
• **Visual Hierarchy**: Large, impactful text with plenty of whitespace
• **Image Treatment**: Full-bleed visuals with subtle overlays for text readability

### **Slidev Configuration:**
yaml
theme: default (customized)
aspectRatio: 16/9
canvasWidth: 1920
fonts:
  sans: 'Inter, system-ui, sans-serif'
  mono: 'JetBrains Mono, monospace'

 ● Path: /Users/oliverjaegle/projects/privat/seal.codes.pitchdeck/LLM_IMAGE_PROMPTS.md

+     1: # LLM Image Generation Prompts for seal.codes Pitch Deck
+     2:
+     3: ## Missing Images to Generate
+     4:
+     5: ### 1. Complex Cryptographic Network (Slide 7 - Expert's Curse)
+     6: **Filename**: `cryptographic-complexity.png`
+     7: **Prompt**:
+     8: ```
+     9: Abstract visualization of complex cryptographic network with PKI certificates, keys, and technical diagrams, dark tech aesthetic, overwhelming complexity. Show interconnected nodes with certificate chains, private keys floating around, complex mathematical formulas, technical documentation scattered, all in a dark blue/black color scheme. The image should convey technical overwhelm and complexity that intimidates regular users. Style: modern tech illustration, slightly chaotic arrangement to show complexity.
+    10: ```
+    11:
+    12: ### 2. Seal Transformation Concept (Slide 8 - Digital Seals Solution)
+    13: **Filename**: `seal-transformation.png`
+    14: **Prompt**:
+    15: ```
+    16: Elegant transformation from ancient wax seal to modern QR code, morphing animation concept, clean modern design. Show a classical royal wax seal on the left gradually transforming/morphing into a clean, modern QR code on the right. Use a smooth gradient transition in the middle. Color scheme: warm gold/red for the wax seal transitioning to clean blue/white for the QR code. Background should be clean and minimal. Style: modern, elegant, showing evolution from old to new.
+    17: ```
+    18:
+    19: ### 3. AI Development Metrics (Slide 13 - Innovation Showcase)
+    20: **Filename**: `ai-development-dashboard.png`
+    21: **Prompt**:
+    22: ```
+    23: Modern development dashboard showing AI collaboration metrics, code generation statistics, innovation visualization, tech aesthetic. Display charts showing 88% AI contribution, code generation graphs, development timeline, collaboration between human and AI. Include elements like: progress bars, pie charts, code snippets, AI icons, bolt.new branding elements. Color scheme: modern blues and purples with white background. Style: clean, professional dashboard UI with data visualization elements.
+    24: ```
+    25:
+    26: ### 4. Global Trust Network (Slide 14 - The Vision)
+    27: **Filename**: `global-trust-network.png`
+    28: **Prompt**:
+    29: ```
+    30: Global network visualization showing connected trust relationships, digital seals spreading across the world, hopeful and expansive. Show a world map with glowing connection lines between continents, small seal/QR code icons scattered across different locations, data flowing between nodes, representing global trust network. Color scheme: deep blue background with bright blue/cyan connection lines and golden seal icons. Style: futuristic, optimistic, showing global connectivity and trust spreading worldwide.
+    31: ```
+    32:
+    33: ## Usage Instructions
+    34:
+    35: 1. Generate these images using your preferred AI image generator (DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, etc.)
+    36: 2. Save them in the `/public` folder with the specified filenames
+    37: 3. The slides are already configured to use these images once they're available
+    38:
+    39: ## Current Workarounds
+    40:
+    41: The presentation currently uses:
+    42: - Text-based visualization for Slide 7 (Expert's Curse)
+    43: - Icon-based transformation concept for Slide 8 (Digital Seals)
+    44: - Metrics display with numbers for Slide 13 (Innovation)
+    45: - Icon grid for Slide 14 (Vision)
+    46:
+    47: These work well but the custom images will enhance the visual impact significantly.

## 🎉 CODE PHASE COMPLETE!

I've successfully implemented the complete seal.codes hackathon pitch deck! Here's what has been accomplished:

### ✅ What's Been Built:

🎯 Complete 15-Slide Presentation
• **Narrative Arc**: Trust crisis → Ancient wisdom → Modern solution → Transformative impact
• **Perfect Timing**: 8-minute presentation (30-40 seconds per slide)
• **Visual Impact**: Full-page visuals with minimal text per slide

🎨 Professional Design
• **Custom Styling**: seal.codes branding with modern blue gradient theme
• **Responsive Layouts**: Cover, image-left, image-right optimized for different content
• **Typography**: Clean Inter font with proper hierarchy
• **Video Integration**: Background videos for slides 2 and 3

📝 Comprehensive Content
• **Speaker Notes**: Detailed 8-minute script for each slide
• **Asset Integration**: All existing images and videos properly embedded
• **Story Flow**: Sarah (creator) and Alex (buyer) character narratives

🛠 Technical Excellence
• **Slidev Framework**: Modern Vue-based presentation system
• **Presenter Mode**: Full speaker notes and navigation
• **Export Ready**: PDF and static site generation configured
• **Documentation**: Complete README and setup instructions

### 🎯 Key Features Implemented:

1. Slide 1: Compelling title with logo
2. Slides 2-3: Video backgrounds showing trust and ancient seals
3. Slides 4-6: Problem setup with character stories
4. Slides 7-8: Expert's curse and elegant solution
5. Slides 9-10: How it works and verification demo
6. Slides 11-12: Success stories for Sarah and Alex
7. Slides 13-14: Innovation showcase and vision
8. Slide 15: Strong call to action

### 📋 Ready to Use:

bash
# Start the presentation
npm run dev

# Access presenter mode
# Navigate to http://localhost:3030/presenter


### 🎨 Optional Enhancements:
• **LLM Image Prompts**: Documented in LLM_IMAGE_PROMPTS.md for 4 additional custom images
• **Current Workarounds**: Text and icon-based visualizations work well as fallbacks

## **The presentation is ready for your hackathon pitch!**
