# Predictable results

From here on, I didn't intervene mch anymore as the plan and architecture were quite clear – at least to me as a Non-Golang dev ;)

So you might just check the result in the [demo-branch](https://github.com/mrsimpson/responsible-vibe-mcp/tree/demo-todo-greenfield/examples/greenfield-todo/todo)

**But it absolutely makes sense to observe and intervene if funny things happen** – and they do!
