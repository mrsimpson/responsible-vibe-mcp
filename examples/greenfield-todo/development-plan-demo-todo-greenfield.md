_Generated on 2025-10-02 by Vibe Feature MCP_
_Workflow: [greenfield](https://mrsimpson.github.io/responsible-vibe-mcp/workflows/greenfield)_

## Goal

Build a todo application that allows users to manage their tasks effectively

## Ideation

### Tasks

- [x] Define target users and their needs
- [x] Identify core features and functionality
- [x] Research existing todo solutions and gaps
- [x] Define success metrics
- [x] Establish detailed project scope (what's in/out)
- [x] Define CLI interface and commands
- [x] Finalize edge case handling decisions
- [x] Create user personas and use cases
- [x] Document requirements in PRD

### Completed

- [x] Created development plan file

## Architecture

### Phase Entrance Criteria:

- [x] Requirements have been thoroughly defined and documented
- [x] User personas and use cases are clearly identified
- [x] Project scope is well-defined (what's in and out of scope)
- [x] Success metrics and acceptance criteria are established

### Tasks

- [x] Evaluate programming language options
- [x] Design CLI argument parsing approach
- [x] Design YAML file structure and operations
- [x] Define error handling strategy
- [x] Consider cross-platform compatibility
- [x] Design modular architecture
- [x] Document technical decisions in architecture.md

### Completed

_None yet_

## Plan

### Phase Entrance Criteria:

- [x] Technical architecture has been designed and documented
- [x] Technology stack has been selected with justification
- [x] System components and their interactions are defined
- [x] Non-functional requirements are addressed

### Tasks

- [x] Create detailed implementation roadmap
- [x] Break down development into phases
- [x] Identify task dependencies and order
- [x] Plan testing strategy
- [x] Document detailed design specifications
- [x] Organize coding tasks in Code section

### Completed

_None yet_

## Code

### Phase Entrance Criteria:

- [x] Detailed implementation plan has been created
- [x] Tasks are broken down into actionable items
- [x] Dependencies and risks have been identified
- [x] Development approach and patterns are defined

### Phase 1: Foundation

- [x] Initialize Go module and project structure
- [x] Implement storage.go (YAML file operations)
- [x] Implement task.go (data structures and models)
- [x] Test basic file operations

### Phase 2: Core Commands (MVP)

- [x] Implement add command
- [x] Implement list command (active tasks only)
- [x] Implement complete command
- [x] Test core workflow (add → list → complete)

### Phase 3: Extended Commands

- [x] Implement edit command
- [x] Implement delete command
- [x] Implement list --all command
- [x] Test all CRUD operations

### Phase 4: Polish & Testing

- [x] Implement comprehensive error handling
- [x] Add help system and usage information
- [x] Manual testing of all edge cases
- [x] Cross-platform testing and build

### Completed

- [x] Built fully functional CLI todo app
- [x] All core features implemented and tested
- [x] YAML storage working correctly
- [x] Error handling implemented
- [x] Cross-platform binaries created (Linux, macOS, Windows)

## Finalize

### Phase Entrance Criteria:

- [x] Core functionality has been implemented
- [x] All planned features are working as expected
- [x] Code follows established patterns and standards
- [x] Basic testing has been completed

### Tasks

- [x] Code cleanup - remove debug output and temporary code
- [x] Review and address TODO/FIXME comments
- [x] Update documentation to reflect final implementation
- [x] Final validation and testing
- [x] Create comprehensive project documentation

### Completed

- [x] Code is clean with no debug output or temporary code
- [x] Requirements documentation updated to match implementation
- [x] Comprehensive README.md created with usage examples
- [x] Final testing completed - all functionality verified
- [x] Cross-platform builds validated

## Key Decisions

- **Target User**: Personal use (developer who works primarily on command line)
- **Platform**: CLI application
- **Storage**: YAML file for human readability
- **Scope**: Minimal viable product - CRUD operations + task completion
- **Success Criteria**: Simple, fast, and usable from command line
- **Task IDs**: Incremental counter (never reused), returned from all interactions
- **Metadata**: Record creation date (stored but not displayed by default)
- **Completion**: Mark tasks as done, exclude from default list view
- **File Location**: ~/.todos.yaml
- **Edge Cases**: Graceful error handling, auto-file creation, stable ID management
- **Distribution**: Single multi-platform binary
- **Language**: Go (fast compilation, simple syntax, excellent standard library)
