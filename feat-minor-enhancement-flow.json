PR Workflow (.github/workflows/pr.yml)\n- **Purpose**: Validate code quality on pull requests\n- **Triggers**: Pull request to main branch\n- **Node Matrix**: 18, 20, latest\n- **Jobs**: Test + Build validation\n- **Commands**: `npm ci`, `npm run build`, `npm run test:run`\n\n#### 2. Release Workflow (.github/workflows/release.yml)\n- **Purpose**: Test, version bump, publish, tag\n- **Triggers**: Push to main branch\n- **Tool**: `mathieudutour/github-tag-action@v6.1`\n- **Flow**: Test → Version Bump → npm Publish → Git Tag\n\n#### 3. Package.json Modifications\n- **Name**: Change to `\"@mrsimpson/responsible-vibe-mcp\"`\n- **Add**: `\"files\"` field, `\"engines\"` (Node 18+), `\"repository\"`\n- **Ensure**: `\"main\"` points to dist files\n\n#### 4. Version Bumping Strategy\n- **Conventional Commits**: feat=minor, fix=patch, BREAKING=major\n- **Format**: Git tags as v1.2.3\n- **Automation**: Package.json + git tag created atomically\n\n#### 5. npm Publishing Configuration\n- **Auth**: GitHub secret `NPM_TOKEN`\n- **Access**: `--access public` for scoped package\n- **Condition**: Only publish if version changed\n\n#### 6. Changelog Generation\n- **Tool**: Built-in with mathieudutour/github-tag-action\n- **Output**: CHANGELOG.md + GitHub release notes\n- **Source**: Conventional commit parsing\n\n#### 7. Security & Permissions\n- **Permissions**: `contents: write`, `packages: write`\n- **Isolation**: No secrets in PR workflows\n- **Scope**: Main branch and PRs only\n\n#### 8. Testing Integration\n- **Command**: `npm run test:run` with `INCLUDE_NOISY_TESTS=true`\n- **Coverage**: Full test suite including MCP contract tests\n- **Caching**: node_modules cached for performance\n\n#### 9. Error Handling & Workflow Status\n- **Fail Fast**: Stop on test failures\n- **Conditional Logic**: Only publish if version changed\n- **Status Reporting**: Clear error messages, workflow badges\n- **No Auto-Rollback**: Manual intervention required for issues\n\n### Completed\n- [x] All planning tasks completed\n- [x] Detailed implementation strategy documented\n- [x] Technical approach fully defined\n\n## Code\n### Phase Entrance Criteria:\n- [x] Detailed implementation plan is complete\n- [x] GitHub Actions workflow structure is designed\n- [x] Package.json modifications are planned\n- [x] Versioning automation approach is defined\n- [x] Testing strategy for CI/CD is established\n\n### Tasks\n- [x] Create .github/workflows directory structure\n- [x] Implement PR workflow (.github/workflows/pr.yml)\n- [x] Implement release workflow (.github/workflows/release.yml)\n- [x] Update package.json with scoped name and publishing config\n- [x] Test workflows locally (if possible)\n- [x] Verify all file permissions and structure\n\n### Completed\n- [x] All implementation tasks completed\n- [x] GitHub Actions workflows created and validated\n- [x] Package.json updated with scoped name and publishing config\n- [x] Build process tested successfully\n- [x] YAML and JSON syntax validated\n\n## Commit\n### Phase Entrance Criteria:\n- [ ] All GitHub Actions workflows are implemented and tested\n- [ ] Package.json is properly configured for publishing\n- [ ] Semantic versioning automation is working\n- [ ] CI/CD pipeline successfully builds and tests\n- [ ] Documentation is updated for publishing process\n\n### Tasks\n- [ ] *To be added when this phase becomes active*\n\n### Completed\n*None yet*\n\n## Key Decisions\n- **Repository**: Using existing GitHub repo (https://github.com/mrsimpson/vibe-feature-mcp.git)\n- **Current State**: No existing tags or GitHub Actions (clean slate)\n- **Package Name**: @mrsimpson/responsible-vibe-mcp (scoped npm package)\n- **Versioning**: Conventional commits with automatic semantic versioning\n- **Release Strategy**: Automated releases from main branch pipeline\n- **CI Strategy**: Tests on PR + main, version bump + publish on main\n- **Automation Tool**: GitHub Actions with conventional commits action\n- **Node Version**: 18+ requirement\n- **Version Bump Tool**: mathieudutour/github-tag-action (full-featured with changelog)\n- **Test Strategy**: Full test suite including MCP contract tests\n- **Automation Tool**: GitHub Actions native approach (no external tools like semantic-release)\n\n## Notes\n### Current Project Analysis:\n- **Package.json**: Version 1.0.0, well-structured with proper dependencies\n- **Build System**: TypeScript with dist/ output, comprehensive test suite\n- **Documentation**: Extensive README, SYSTEM_PROMPT.md, LOGGING.md, etc.\n- **Testing**: Vitest with 79+ tests, includes MCP contract testing\n- **Git Status**: On package-for-npmjs branch, clean working directory\n\n### Key Requirements Identified:\n1. **Semantic Versioning**: Automated version bumping with conventional commits\n2. **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline for testing, building, and publishing\n3. **npm Publishing**: Automated publishing to npm registry\n4. **Tag Consistency**: Git tags must match package.json version\n5. **Quality Gates**: Tests must pass before publishing\n6. **Documentation**: Publishing process documentation\n\n### npm Setup Instructions:\n1. **Generate npm Access Token:**\n   - Go to https://www.npmjs.com/settings/tokens\n   - Click \"Generate New Token\" → \"Automation\" (for CI/CD)\n   - Copy the token (starts with `npm_`)\n\n2. **Add GitHub Secret:**\n   - Go to your repo: https://github.com/mrsimpson/vibe-feature-mcp/settings/secrets/actions\n   - Click \"New repository secret\"\n   - Name: `NPM_TOKEN`\n   - Value: Your npm token\n\n3. **Verify npm Package Name:**\n   - Check if `@mrsimpson/responsible-vibe-mcp` is available on npm\n   - May need to create npm organization if @mrsimpson doesn't exist\n\n---\n*This plan is maintained by the LLM. Tool responses provide guidance on which section to focus on and what tasks to work on.*"

Here's my understanding:\n\n## Project Overview\n\n**Responsible Vibe MCP** is a sophisticated Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that acts as an intelligent conversation state manager and development guide for LLMs. It orchestrates feature development conversations by:\n\n### Core Functionality\n- **Managing Conversation State**: Tracks development phases and context across sessions using SQLite\n- **Guiding LLM Behavior**: Provides phase-specific instructions telling LLMs what to do next\n- **Maintaining Project Memory**: Keeps persistent markdown plan files as long-term project memory\n- **Orchestrating Development Flow**: Intelligently determines when to transition between development phases\n- **Ensuring Progress Tracking**: Continuously instructs LLMs to update completed tasks in plan files\n\n### Architecture\nThe project uses a **modular, plan-file-centric information architecture** with:\n\n1. **Static Components** (generic workflow guidance)\n   - System prompts and tool descriptions remain workflow-agnostic\n   - Works with waterfall, bugfix, epcc, or custom workflows\n\n2. **Dynamic Components** (specific phase guidance)\n   - Tool responses provide context-aware, phase-specific instructions\n   - References plan file sections for current tasks\n\n3. **Plan File as Single Source of Truth**\n   - Simple markdown format maintained by LLM\n   - Contains task lists, decisions, and project context\n\n### Key Tools\n- **`whats_next`**: Primary tool that analyzes conversation state and provides LLM instructions\n- **`proceed_to_phase`**: Explicit phase transitions when current phase is complete\n- **`start_development`**: Initiates development with workflow selection\n- **`resume_workflow`**: Resumes development after conversation breaks\n- **`reset_development`**: Clean slate reset for fresh starts\n\n### Current State\nThe project is currently on the `package-for-npmjs` branch, working on setting up professional npm publishing with GitHub Actions. The implementation is **complete** and ready for the commit phase:\n\n- ✅ **GitHub Actions workflows** created (PR validation + release automation)\n- ✅ **Package.json** updated with scoped name `@mrsimpson/responsible-vibe-mcp`\n- ✅ **Semantic versioning** automation with conventional commits\n- ✅ **Full test suite** (96 tests passing)\n- ✅ **Comprehensive documentation** (README, SYSTEM_PROMPT, LOGGING, etc.)\n\n### Technical Details\n- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules\n- **Database**: SQLite for conversation state persistence\n- **Testing**: Vitest with comprehensive unit and E2E tests\n- **Build**: TypeScript compilation to `dist/`\n- **MCP SDK**: Version 1.13.0\n- **Node**: Requires 18+\n\nThe project demonstrates excellent software engineering practices with clean architecture, comprehensive testing, detailed documentation, and professional CI/CD setup. It's ready for npm publishing once the GitHub Actions workflows are committed and the npm token is configured."

Let me clarify a few things before implementing:\n\n## Understanding the Requirements\n\n**New Workflow: \"Minor Enhancement\"**\n- **Explore**: Most of the work happens here (analysis, planning, small implementation)\n- **Plan**: Minimal or potentially skipped\n- **Implement**: Combined code + commit phase (implementation + finalization)\n- **No separate Code/Commit phases**: Streamlined for efficiency\n\n## Questions for Clarification\n\n1. **Workflow Name**: Should I call it `minor` or `enhancement` or something else for the workflow parameter?\n\n2. **Plan Phase**: Should it be:\n   - Completely skipped (Explore → Implement directly)?\n   - Very brief (just key decisions, no detailed tasks)?\n   - Optional (can skip if Explore is comprehensive)?\n\n3. **Explore Phase Scope**: Should it include:\n   - Analysis + small code changes?\n   - Analysis + design + small implementation?\n   - Everything except final testing/commit?\n\n4. **Implement Phase**: Should it focus on:\n   - Final code cleanup + commit preparation?\n   - Testing + documentation + commit?\n   - Just the commit/finalization aspects?\n\n5. **State Machine Integration**: Should this be:\n   - A completely separate workflow file (like `minor.yml`)?\n   - Added to the existing built-in workflows alongside waterfall/epcc/bugfix?\n\n6. **Transition Logic**: Any special rules for when to use this vs. regular EPCC?\n\nBased on your description, I'm thinking:\n```\nExplore (heavy) → Plan (light/optional) → Implement (code+commit combined)\n```\n\nWould you like me to proceed with this structure, or would you prefer to clarify any of these points first?"

    "Perfect! Now I'm fully familiar with the **Responsible Vibe MCP Server** project. Here's my understanding:\n\n## Project Overview\n\n**Responsible Vibe MCP** is a sophisticated Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that acts as an intelligent conversation state manager and development guide for LLMs. It orchestrates feature development conversations by:\n\n### Core Functionality\n- **Managing Conversation State**: Tracks development phases and context across sessions using SQLite\n- **Guiding LLM Behavior**: Provides phase-specific instructions telling LLMs what to do next\n- **Maintaining Project Memory**: Keeps persistent markdown plan files as long-term project memory\n- **Orchestrating Development Flow**: Intelligently determines when to transition between development phases\n- **Ensuring Progress Tracking**: Continuously instructs LLMs to update completed tasks in plan files\n\n### Architecture\nThe project uses a **modular, plan-file-centric information architecture** with:\n\n1. **Static Components** (generic workflow guidance)\n   - System prompts and tool descriptions remain workflow-agnostic\n   - Works with waterfall, bugfix, epcc, or custom workflows\n\n2. **Dynamic Components** (specific phase guidance)\n   - Tool responses provide context-aware, phase-specific instructions\n   - References plan file sections for current tasks\n\n3. **Plan File as Single Source of Truth**\n   - Simple markdown format maintained by LLM\n   - Contains task lists, decisions, and project context\n\n### Key Tools\n- **`whats_next`**: Primary tool that analyzes conversation state and provides LLM instructions\n- **`proceed_to_phase`**: Explicit phase transitions when current phase is complete\n- **`start_development`**: Initiates development with workflow selection\n- **`resume_workflow`**: Resumes development after conversation breaks\n- **`reset_development`**: Clean slate reset for fresh starts\n\n### Current State\nThe project is currently on the `package-for-npmjs` branch, working on setting up professional npm publishing with GitHub Actions. The implementation is **complete** and ready for the commit phase:\n\n- ✅ **GitHub Actions workflows** created (PR validation + release automation)\n- ✅ **Package.json** updated with scoped name `@mrsimpson/responsible-vibe-mcp`\n- ✅ **Semantic versioning** automation with conventional commits\n- ✅ **Full test suite** (96 tests passing)\n- ✅ **Comprehensive documentation** (README, SYSTEM_PROMPT, LOGGING, etc.)\n\n### Technical Details\n- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules\n- **Database**: SQLite for conversation state persistence\n- **Testing**: Vitest with comprehensive unit and E2E tests\n- **Build**: TypeScript compilation to `dist/`\n- **MCP SDK**: Version 1.13.0\n- **Node**: Requires 18+\n\nThe project demonstrates excellent software engineering practices with clean architecture, comprehensive testing, detailed documentation, and professional CI/CD setup. It's ready for npm publishing once the GitHub Actions workflows are committed and the npm token is configured.\n[Tool uses: none]",
    "> I want you to add a workflow for minor enhancements. Basically something like epcc, but for developments with a much smaller impact. In this case, the plan is not much necessary as most of it should be done in \"explore\". \"Implement\" would then include the contents from code + commit. questions?",
    "I understand you want to add a new workflow for minor enhancements - essentially a streamlined version of EPCC that's optimized for small-impact changes. Let me clarify a few things before implementing:\n\n## Understanding the Requirements\n\n**New Workflow: \"Minor Enhancement\"**\n- **Explore**: Most of the work happens here (analysis, planning, small implementation)\n- **Plan**: Minimal or potentially skipped\n- **Implement**: Combined code + commit phase (implementation + finalization)\n- **No separate Code/Commit phases**: Streamlined for efficiency\n\n## Questions for Clarification\n\n1. **Workflow Name**: Should I call it `minor` or `enhancement` or something else for the workflow parameter?\n\n2. **Plan Phase**: Should it be:\n   - Completely skipped (Explore → Implement directly)?\n   - Very brief (just key decisions, no detailed tasks)?\n   - Optional (can skip if Explore is comprehensive)?\n\n3. **Explore Phase Scope**: Should it include:\n   - Analysis + small code changes?\n   - Analysis + design + small implementation?\n   - Everything except final testing/commit?\n\n4. **Implement Phase**: Should it focus on:\n   - Final code cleanup + commit preparation?\n   - Testing + documentation + commit?\n   - Just the commit/finalization aspects?\n\n5. **State Machine Integration**: Should this be:\n   - A completely separate workflow file (like `minor.yml`)?\n   - Added to the existing built-in workflows alongside waterfall/epcc/bugfix?\n\n6. **Transition Logic**: Any special rules for when to use this vs. regular EPCC?\n\nBased on your description, I'm thinking:\n```\nExplore (heavy) → Plan (light/optional) → Implement (code+commit combined)\n```\n\nWould you like me to proceed with this structure, or would you prefer to clarify any of these points first?\n[Tool uses: none]",
