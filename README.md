# Vibe Feature MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that acts as an intelligent conversation state manager and development guide for LLMs. This server orchestrates feature development conversations by maintaining state, determining development phases, and providing contextual instructions to guide LLMs through structured development processes.

## Overview

**Vibe Feature MCP** serves as a conversation coordinator that:

- **Manages Conversation State**: Tracks development phase and conversation context across sessions
- **Guides LLM Behavior**: Provides phase-specific instructions telling the LLM what to do next
- **Maintains Project Memory**: Keeps a persistent markdown plan file that serves as long-term project memory
- **Orchestrates Development Flow**: Intelligently determines when to transition between development phases
- **Ensures Progress Tracking**: Continuously instructs the LLM to update completed tasks in the plan file

## Core Interaction Pattern

```
User: "implement auth"
  ↓
LLM: calls whats_next()
  ↓
Responsible-Vibe-MCP: analyzes context → determines phase → returns instructions
  ↓
LLM: follows instructions → interacts with user → updates plan file
  ↓
LLM: calls whats_next() again
  ↓
[cycle continues...]
```

### Core Building Blocks

#### 1. **Conversation Manager**
The Conversation Manager handles conversation identification, state persistence, and coordination between components.

**Responsibilities:**
- Generate unique conversation identifiers from project path + git branch
- Load and persist conversation state from/to database
- Coordinate state updates across components
- Handle conversation lifecycle (creation, updates, cleanup)
- Provide conversation-scoped state isolation
- Manage project-specific development context

**Key Features:**
- **Project-Aware Identification**: Uses absolute project path + current git branch as conversation identifier
- **Git Integration**: Automatically detects git branch changes and creates separate conversation contexts

- Single `whats_next` tool interface
- JSON-based instruction delivery
- Context-aware response generation

#### 2. **File System Integration**
- Plan file creation and management
- Project directory detection
- Git repository integration

#### 3. **Development Tool Integration**
- Compatible with existing development workflows
- Non-intrusive plan file placement
- Standard markdown format for universal compatibility

## State Machine

The server operates as a state machine that transitions between development phases. While the diagram shows the typical linear progression, **users can transition directly to any phase at any time** using the `proceed_to_phase` tool

For a comprehensive reference of all state transitions, including detailed instructions and transition reasons, see [TRANSITIONS.md](./TRANSITIONS.md).

## Logging and Debugging

The server includes comprehensive logging with configurable levels for debugging, monitoring, and troubleshooting:

### Log Levels
- **DEBUG**: Detailed tracing and execution flow
- **INFO**: Success operations and important milestones (default)
- **WARN**: Expected errors and recoverable issues  
- **ERROR**: Caught but unexpected errors

### Configuration
Set the log level using the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable:

```bash
# Debug level (most verbose)
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG npx tsx src/index.ts

# Production level
LOG_LEVEL=INFO node dist/index.js
```

### Log Components
- **Server**: Main server operations and tool handlers
- **Database**: SQLite operations and state persistence
- **ConversationManager**: Conversation context management
- **TransitionEngine**: Phase transition analysis
- **PlanManager**: Plan file operations

For detailed logging documentation, see [LOGGING.md](./LOGGING.md).

## Features

### 1. Intelligent Phase Management

The server manages five core development phases, each with specific guidance:

#### Requirements Analysis
- Instructs LLM to analyze user requests and clarify the WHAT
- Guides the LLM to ask clarifying questions about functionality
- Directs the LLM to break down needs into specific tasks
- Ensures the LLM continuously marks completed requirements tasks

#### Design
- Instructs LLM to help user design technical solutions (the HOW)
- Guides the LLM to ask about quality goals and technology preferences
- Directs the LLM to document architectural decisions
- Ensures the LLM marks completed design tasks and updates plan

#### Implementation
- Instructs LLM to guide code implementation following best practices
- Guides the LLM to help with coding standards and structure
- Directs the LLM to track implementation progress
- Ensures the LLM marks completed implementation tasks

#### Quality Assurance
- Instructs LLM to guide code review and quality validation
- Guides the LLM to ensure requirements are properly met
- Directs the LLM to help with testing and documentation
- Ensures the LLM marks completed QA tasks

#### Testing
- Instructs LLM to guide comprehensive testing strategies
- Guides the LLM to help create and execute test plans
- Directs the LLM to validate feature completeness
- Ensures the LLM marks completed testing tasks

### 2. Conversation State Persistence

- **Phase Tracking**: Current development phase and transition history
- **Context Memory**: Conversation context and progress indicators
- **Plan Synchronization**: Ensures plan file stays updated with latest progress

### 3. Dynamic Plan Management

The server ensures the LLM maintains a living development plan document:

- **Project Overview**: Feature goals, scope, and current status
- **Phase Progress**: Tasks, deliverables, and completion status
- **Decision Log**: Important technical and design decisions
- **Timeline**: Progress tracking and milestone completion

## Development Workflow

### Starting Development

Development must be explicitly initiated using the `start_development` tool, which allows users to select their preferred workflow:

```
start_development({ workflow: "waterfall" })
```

Available workflows include:
- **waterfall**: Classical waterfall development process (default)
- **agile**: Iterative development with sprint cycles
- **custom**: Custom workflow defined in `.vibe/state-machine.yaml`

> **Important**: The `start_development` tool must be called before any other tools (`whats_next`, `proceed_to_phase`, `resume_workflow`). This ensures that development follows a deliberate workflow selection process.

## Phase Progression Flow

### How Users Advance Through Development Phases

After development has been started, the responsible-vibe-mcp server guides users through a structured development process using a two-tool approach that gives users full control over phase transitions:

#### 1. **Continuous Guidance with `whats_next`**
- LLM calls `whats_next()` after each user interaction
- Server analyzes current phase progress and plan file status
- Returns phase-specific instructions for what to do next

#### 2. **Explicit Phase Transitions with `proceed_to_phase`**
- When all tasks in a phase are complete, `whats_next()` suggests moving forward
- LLM uses `proceed_to_phase()` to explicitly transition to the next phase
- User maintains full control over pacing and can choose to refine current phase

### Phase Progression Pattern

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Request] --> B[LLM calls whats_next]
    B --> C{Phase Complete?}
    
    C -->|No| D[Continue Current Phase]
    D --> E[Follow Phase Instructions]
    E --> F[Update Plan File]
    F --> G[User Interaction]
    G --> B
    
    C -->|Yes| H[Suggest Phase Transition]
    H --> I{User Ready?}
    I -->|No| D
    I -->|Yes| J[LLM calls proceed_to_phase]
    J --> K[Transition to Next Phase]
    K --> B
```

### Example Phase Progression

#### Starting a New Feature
```
User: "I want to implement user authentication"
LLM: *calls whats_next()*
responsible-vibe-mcp: "New feature detected. Starting requirements analysis. Ask the user clarifying questions about WHAT they need for authentication..."
```

#### Working Within a Phase
```
LLM: *asks clarifying questions, updates plan file*
LLM: *calls whats_next()*
responsible-vibe-mcp: "Continue requirements gathering. You still need to clarify password policies and session management..."
```

#### Completing a Phase
```
LLM: *completes all requirements tasks*
LLM: *calls whats_next()*
responsible-vibe-mcp: "All requirements tasks are complete! ✅ You can proceed to design phase using 'proceed_to_phase' tool, or continue refining requirements if needed."
```

#### Transitioning to Next Phase
```
LLM: "Great! We've covered all authentication requirements. Let's move to design."
LLM: *calls proceed_to_phase(target_phase: "design", reason: "requirements complete")*
responsible-vibe-mcp: "Transitioning to design phase. Help the user design the technical solution. Ask about architecture, technologies, and quality goals..."
```

### Phase Completion Indicators

Each phase is considered complete when:

- **Requirements**: All user needs documented, scope confirmed, tasks broken down
- **Design**: Technical approach defined, architecture decided, technology choices made
- **Implementation**: Core functionality built, code structured, basic testing done
- **Quality Assurance**: Code reviewed, requirements validated, documentation complete
- **Testing**: Test plans executed, coverage verified, feature validated

### Refinement and Flexibility

Users can always choose to:
- **Stay in current phase**: Even when "complete," users can add more tasks or refine existing work
- **Go back**: Use `proceed_to_phase` to return to earlier phases if issues are discovered
- **Skip ahead**: In rare cases, jump to later phases if earlier work is already done

This approach ensures users maintain full control over the development process while receiving structured guidance from responsible-vibe-mcp.

## LLM System Prompt Integration

To properly integrate with responsible-vibe-mcp, the LLM should be configured with a system prompt that establishes the interaction pattern. The key requirement for the stateless approach is that the LLM must provide conversation context when calling `whats_next()`.

### Key Requirements for LLM Integration:

1. **Always call whats_next() after user interactions**
2. **Provide conversation context**: Include summary and recent messages
3. **Follow instructions precisely** from responsible-vibe-mcp
4. **Continuously update the plan file** as instructed
5. **Mark completed tasks** when directed

### Conversation Context Parameters:

When calling `whats_next()`, the LLM should provide:
- **context**: Brief description of current situation
- **user_input**: The user's latest message or request  
- **conversation_summary**: Summary of the conversation so far (optional but recommended)
- **recent_messages**: Array of recent relevant messages (optional)

This stateless approach ensures that responsible-vibe-mcp can make informed decisions about phase transitions without storing potentially inconsistent conversation history.

For a complete system prompt template, see [SYSTEM_PROMPT.md](./SYSTEM_PROMPT.md).

## Interaction Logging

Vibe Feature MCP includes a comprehensive interaction logging system that records all tool calls and responses for debugging and analysis purposes:

### Logged Information

- **Tool Calls**: All calls to `whats_next` and `proceed_to_phase` tools
- **Input Parameters**: Complete request parameters for each tool call
- **Response Data**: Complete response data returned to the LLM
- **Current Phase**: Development phase at the time of the interaction
- **Timestamp**: When the interaction occurred
- **Conversation ID**: Which conversation the interaction belongs to

### Data Storage

All interaction logs are stored in the local SQLite database in the `.vibe` directory of your project. The data is stored without masking or filtering, as it is kept locally on your system.

### Querying Logs

Logs can be queried by conversation ID for analysis and debugging purposes. No UI is provided in the current implementation, but the database can be accessed directly using SQLite tools.

**Note**: All interaction data is stored locally on your system and is never transmitted to external services.
