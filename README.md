[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/responsible-vibe-mcp.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/responsible-vibe-mcp)

Transform any AI coding agent into a structured development partner with battle-tested engineering workflows.

## âš¡ Quick Start

```bash
# Setup your coding agent
npx responsible-vibe-mcp --generate-config amazonq-cli  # or claude, gemini, opencode
# OR manually configure any MCP agent with our system prompt, check the docs for that
```

Head over to a new empty dir and ask your agent: _"Build a UNO-like card game"_ â€“ and instantly experience how your agent doesn't just shoot, but starts engineering â€“ with YOU in the driver seat!

## What You Get

âœ… **Multiple battle-tested workflows** (classical [V-model "waterfall"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-model), [Anthropic's EPCC](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices), [Test-Driven-Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), Reproduction-based bugfix, and many more)

âœ… **Context-aware process guidance**: Your agent will take notes and plan tasks which survive context compression and even sessions.

âœ… **Project memory across conversations** and branches

âœ… **Automatic documentation** and decision tracking

## Universal MCP Support

Works in any agent that supports the Model-Context-Protocol. Whenever a new IDE or Terminal UI rises: You don't need to change the way you work.

## How It's Different

There are zillions of "game changer next gen IDEs" out there, each claiming they will revolutionalize how software is going to be created.

In the end, they all just manipulate context of a transformer based LLM â€“ it's all [just noodle soup](https://mrsimpson.github.io/slides-context-is-all-you-need/22). And they are fast at changing wha't going to be part of the context, and it's even getting accelerated by parallel agents.

The problem: **The faster agents become, the harder it is to engineer**. I strongly believe that software engineering is a **creative process** which majorly happens inside the engineers brain.

Responsible-Vibe-MCP helps to **fill the conversation context with contents from YOUR brain** â€“ instead of relying the agent will have understood what you should have thought about.

And since may developers tend to through structured processing off the cliff once they think they start coding, responsible-vibe-mcp will maintain **proactive process guidance** - your AI knows what to do next in each development phase, follow proven engineering methodologies, and maintain long-term project context.
